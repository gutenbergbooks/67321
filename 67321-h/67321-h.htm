  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This volume is given to the public without other excuse
than the simple fact that it has been written. If it is read
it may do some good, but in any event it cannot do injury.
If it is not read the hour which knew it will pass with
it, and countless hours, like waves in Time’s ocean, will
roll on multitudinously, with their burdens of good and
evil, and pass also.</p>

<p class='c008'>Because the writer believed he had a thought to express,
which, if heeded, would help, in some slight degree, to
right human wrongs, he ventured to offer it in this form.
He had discovered by experience that no radical and permanent
reform can be successfully effected without the
consent of what are called “the substantial business interests”
of the established system.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has also observed that the system now in operation
is constantly undergoing changes, and that our predecessors
in its control, of a quarter of a century ago, would
scarcely recognize the system by which we live to-day.
These changes have been accomplished through evolution
only. Numbers count for nothing. Millions submit readily
to the will of one.</p>

<p class='c008'>Education counts for everything, and if we had been
taught that to stand on our heads an hour a day was essential
to salvation most of us would observe that form without
question. Some, however, are superior to error and
are strong enough to be and to do right. But these are
scattered. They argue with their unthinking neighbors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and are ridiculed for their pains. Such methods never did
succeed and the world is as much out of gear with righteousness
to-day as it was in the dark ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is the trouble with political Co-operation. It cannot
succeed except in a very slight measure. Why? Because
industrial and commercial education are against it.
Because the Industrial System is against it. Because the
great, the powerful and strong are against it. Political Co-operation
has no money with which to compete with the
competitive system. Righteousness without money is a
will-o’-the-wisp as against Mephisto, with millions in the
competitive system.</p>

<p class='c008'>Co-operation must enter the lists with means and weapons
similar to its opponents, or else it will fail. Therefore
the writer proposes that the profits of co-operation be
matched against the profits of competition, and if co-operation
can “win out” then the profit system is dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us raise the cry of Industrial Co-operation against
Industrial Competition, and then go to work. When we are
strong enough we will do what Industrial Competition in
the form of corporations and syndicates has done. We will
become political. Industrially we can grow as all industrial
institutions have, and when we are grown to a magnitude
which forces recognition, the world is ours and again
belongs, not to a few, but to all of us.</p>

<p class='c008'>This little volume is designed to show, in part, what an
opportunity we have to plant the flag of Industrial Co-operation
on American soil and defend it as it cannot be
defended in any other country.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='large'>THE YEAR 1897.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>During the entire existence of the great American republic
no year seemed more hopeless to the masses of its
people than the year 1897.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is true that the dark hours of conflict, when separation
from Great Britain was sought at the cannon’s mouth,
and later, when civil strife nearly rent the nation in twain,
seemed, to superficial observers, to be more fraught with
danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the problems of those times could be and were readily
understood. Success to the arms of the patriots, in the
one case, and the Unionists in the other, was a simple
solution, although distressing in its pursuit and difficult
of achievement.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this year was one which was the culmination of
many years of singular abundance, blessed by nature in almost
every conceivable way, and yet by a strange contradiction
of circumstances full of sorrow, distress, hunger and
poverty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wealth of this, the richest country in the world, was
made valueless by reason of the belief on the part of its
people that it must borrow the right to use that wealth
from other nations. The supplies of food, clothing and
materials of all kinds were vast, and yet the inhabitants
for some cause were not able to obtain them, although
their needs were great. There were now a few rich and
many—very many—extremely poor.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was this strange, contradictory, confusing and incomprehensible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>condition which made men hopeless. Where
to look for help, what to do, the cause, the consequence,
the evil and the remedy, were all subjects of agitation and
deep concern. Everybody except those few who were satisfied
with any condition which did not disturb their own
happiness, had views on these subjects and had conceived
of some remedy. And the multiplicity of these views and
the innumerable varieties of remedies proposed, seemed
to aggravate the general despair and produce an increasing
paralysis of action.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was in January of that dismal year that I found myself
in the great city of Chicago. I, too, had been affected by
the universal depreciation of property, so that a fortune of
fifty thousand dollars, which I had inherited from my
parents, was now dubiously estimated to have dwindled to
something like ten thousand dollars. I knew it was not
my fault.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bank stocks, railroad stocks and mining stocks, represented
the bulk of my poor, deceased father’s savings and
investments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much of this could not attract buyers at any price. Some
could not be given away. The rest was convertible into
gold at a few cents on the dollar.</p>

<p class='c008'>But I was too young, being only twenty-five years of age,
to become despondent over the loss of money, and I had
traveled so extensively about my own country and seen
its countless opportunities that I felt a certain elation in
the prospect of building up a fortune of my own.</p>

<p class='c008'>So that, although a stranger in Chicago, with no friends
nearer than Massachusetts, and without the smallest idea
of a plan for the future, I yet had a firm belief in God, man,
my country and myself.</p>

<p class='c008'>I did not even doubt the system which had robbed me
of my fortune, and was inclined to look upon all who
denounced it as hostile to the best interests of mankind.</p>

<p class='c008'>My education was, in a large measure, responsible for
this. Born in Salem, Massachusetts, one of the oldest,
sleepiest and most conservative of American cities, educated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>in her schools and in one of the staid old colleges,
for which New England was justly famous, how could I
have imbibed anything but ancient, sleepy and conservative
theories of political economy, and fine, staid and somewhat
musty notions of the end and purpose of man?</p>

<p class='c008'>It is true that my extensive travels had broadened me
somewhat mentally. They had taught me the value of individual
men and had rather obliterated sectional pride,
which I was willing to confess was the besetting sin of the
average New Englander; they had made me acquainted
with manners and customs and had produced in me a
capability of adjusting myself to delicate situations.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this sort of breadth, while excellent and serviceable,
did not render me tolerant of ideas which were at
variance with those commonly accepted. My distinguishing
characteristic, on which I prided myself not a little,
was an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the history and
resources of my own country. I mention this particularly
now, because I had occasion, later on, to turn my knowledge
to a very useful purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was inclined to remain in Chicago. There was no reason
for it which I had defined to myself, and I really believe
that, of all the dismal places I had ever seen, Chicago
was the most dismal at that time. I did not have any
occupation, attraction or hope to keep me in this maelstrom
of the human ocean.</p>

<p class='c008'>I did not like it. I had no friends in it. I did not
seem to find companions. Indeed, I was happy in being
alone, and enjoyed a certain discontent, which was productive
of thoughtfulness, and which set me to expressing
my thoughts on paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Governed by an instinctive prudence, which is characteristic
of the New England mind, I had selected a room
in a respectable private house, where there were also two
other roomers, and took my meals at a neighboring restaurant.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>JOHN THOMPSON—CO-OPERATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One day after I had been settled in Chicago for, perhaps,
two or three weeks, the sun shone so brightly and the
weather was so mild that I was tempted to stroll out, on so
exceptional an occasion for Chicago, into the suburbs of the
great city. As I wandered along aimlessly, watching the
gay sleighing parties, I saw one of the young men who
roomed in the same house coming toward me from the opposite
direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>I had become so far acquainted with him as to have
learned that his name was Thompson, and had overheard
some of his conversation with companions who called at his
room. What I had heard and seen did not impress me
favorably. He seemed to entertain and express views of
an economic nature which were not in accord with my New
England notions, and I was disposed to avoid him. My
first impulse, in fact, was to cross this street and continue
my way alone. Before I could do this, however,
Thompson hailed me with a cheerful, courteous and familiar
“How do you do?” So cordial, good-natured and
attractive seemed his manner, devoid of all affectation or
obtrusiveness, that I stopped, returned his salutation and
suddenly became conscious of a desire to have company in
my walk. So I asked him which way he was bound, and on
his replying that he was simply taking a stroll we both
turned into a side street, and continuing the walk together
entered into conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thompson was really a remarkable looking man. I
marveled, as I walked along with him, that I had not noticed
this in the two weeks that we had roomed in the same
house, but probably it was because we saw each other only
once in awhile in the hallway as we passed. I now observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>that he was a man fully six feet tall, erect and powerfully
built, with a thoughtful, clean-shaven face, strong features
and great earnest, commanding eyes. Indeed it seemed to
me that I never had seen such eyes before. One felt that
they belonged to a master and that this man was a natural
leader of his kind. But I then thought, and afterward
learned, that he was not only a leader but a thinker. Such
a man could, if his heart was enlisted in any cause, sacrifice
not merely life, but, if need be, reputation for the good
cause in which he believed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have thought, Mr. Braden,” said he, as we sauntered
along together, “that you might be interested in a little
project some of us have to improve the condition of the
masses of our people. Have you ever studied the question
of co-operation?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir,” said I. “I have never studied the question of
co-operation. I presume you mean, sir, co-operation among
laborers. But while I have not studied it I must admit that
I have little sympathy with the theory. It is not practicable
and all attempts which I have observed have failed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pardon me, Mr. Braden,” returned my companion. “I
feel that you have not observed the noble and very successful
co-operative enterprises which flourish throughout
Europe and to some extent in the United States at this
time. The truth is, co-operation has proven to be and is
strikingly practicable. In the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland $60,000,000.00 and more constitutes
the accumulated capital of co-operative societies and on the
continent of Europe the capital involved is much greater.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not my purpose to detail our discussion of this subject.
Suffice it to say that nearly the whole day was spent
in each other’s society. Although by no means convinced
at the close of the day that Thompson was correct in his
views, I found myself deeply interested. I resolved to
study the subject and study it fairly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The project which my new acquaintance outlined was
one which I at once pronounced visionary. It was, he said,
the design of certain gentlemen, some of whom lived in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Chicago, to organize what they called the Co-operative
Commonwealth. These gentlemen had decided to induce
laboring men and other persons who might be willing to
associate themselves in the work to form co-operative societies
and to colonize them in some one state, so that, in
process of time, they would outvote the devotees of the old
system. When this desired result was achieved, they made
no doubt that the Co-operative Commonwealth would be
established and present to the entire world an example of
prosperity which would rouse an unquenchable spirit of
emulation. I could not forbear to sneer at the plan when it
was explained, but when I saw how serious Thompson was,
and looking into his face felt the impression of his strong
character, I was inclined to think about it and began, involuntarily,
to picture to myself an ideal of the Co-operative
Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c008'>That day Thompson and I were together much of the
time and went to the public library, at his suggestion, to
prove some of his statements, the correctness of which I
had disputed. I was obliged to admit, when we parted,
that he had made no mistake, and this satisfied me that he
was an authority on social and economic questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>This man was, at the time when our meeting and conversation
occurred, about thirty-five years of age. He was an
Englishman by birth, but came to this country when only
three years of age with his parents, and settled in Red Bluff,
California, where his mother died shortly after. When
about fifteen he removed with his father to a mining town
in Nevada, where the father speedily acquired a fortune in
mercantile pursuits and in some fortunate speculations in
mining stocks. The son was impatient of restraint as a
boy, ran away from home, and visited nearly all the mining
camps in the west, followed every excitement, became a
skillful miner and acquired an immense fund of useful and
curious information.</p>

<p class='c008'>When about thirty he drifted to Chicago and worked at a
variety of occupations, being a master of many, but never
rose above the station of a journeyman. This was due to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>the fact that he worked only that he might obtain money to
procure books, principally on questions of political economy,
and had no aspiration to follow any life but that of a
student. One day when he had been in the city for some
years he saw his father, now an old man, in the crowd on
State street. He had lost all trace of him many years before,
and once in his wanderings he had gone to the Nevada
mining town where he last saw him, and had found the
town deserted except by two old men, who could give him
no information as to where his father had gone. They
simply knew that when he went away he was accounted one
of the wealthiest men in the camp. Now, meeting him on
the street of the great city, he observed that he seemed to
have about him every indication of wealth and position.
He spoke to him, calling him father, and was recognized by
the old gentleman, but with some difficulty. Events following
were sufficiently interesting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thompson was taken to his father’s palatial residence on
the Wisconsin lake shore, not far from Chicago, and for a
while lived in great luxury. But this was ill suited to his
character and entirely at variance with the habits he had
formed during his rough western life. He became restless,
and made numerous trips to the city, where he spent his
time in the libraries and among his books. His father, who
was in truth very wealthy, usually went south in the winter
and was in Florida at that time. On the day when I met
the son he designed to take the evening train for his father’s
southern home, intending to go from there to Arizona,
where the old gentleman has some mining interests, but
expecting to return to Chicago in March.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he parted with me that afternoon he urged me to
pursue certain economic lines of inquiry, advising me what
books to read, and requesting me to give him my views on
co-operation when he should next meet me. This I promised
to do, and when we went our several ways I found myself
looking at the world with new eyes, but with a feeling
that I was getting on rather too familiar terms with a number
of political heresies.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>A MEETING OF THE CO-OPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH—COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO VISIT IDAHO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After the introduction of the subject to my notice, in the
manner described in the foregoing pages, I spent nearly all
of my time for at least a month in the study of such books
as had been suggested to me, treating upon the condition of
labor in what is ordinarily called the Christian world. I
was engaged in this occupation when Thompson returned
from his trip to the South and West. To say that I had
become convinced that Thompson’s plan of co-operation
and the establishment of a Co-operative Commonwealth
was practicable would not be true, but in all my researches
I had kept his plan in mind and confessed that I was
anxious to see it put into practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was not convinced by any means that it would succeed,
but I wanted to observe its workings and believed that it
could do no evil. Therefore when I again met Thompson
about the middle of March, I made haste to assure him
that I was prepared to approve his theories and desirous
of taking some part in the experiment which I hoped
would be tried. Upon learning this, Thompson informed
me that he was already a member of the Co-operative
Commonwealth, that a meeting of some of the most
influential projectors would be held that evening, and
that he would like to have me present. I readily accepted
the invitation and at the appointed time and place met him
that evening, and together we went to the meeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was quite surprised upon entering the little hall where
his friends had assembled to find myself in the midst of well-dressed,
refined, intellectual and apparently practical men.
Thompson introduced me to a number of these as a friend
who was interested in the Co-operative Commonwealth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>who would, as he thought, contribute to its success.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although I felt that this recommendation of me was premature,
yet I made no objection to it, because I preferred to
accept the cordial reception which his introduction seemed
to procure for me. We spent about half an hour in conversation
on subjects involving the co-operative idea. I
had little to say, personally, but rather confined myself to
asking questions until the meeting was called to order.
But from what was told me in answer to my questions I was
deeply impressed by the apparent sincerity and general
benevolence which pervaded the assemblage.</p>

<p class='c008'>I confess that I rather expected to find a somewhat motley
crowd of men, with wild staring eyes, shaggy, unkempt
heads and beards, indulging with furious gestures and
loud voices in bitter and irrational denunciation of the
government and public institutions of my country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of that these men were as sleek, as mild, as quiet
and gentlemanly as an equal number of bank presidents
might be. Perhaps more so. At any rate, I have seen bank
presidents and directors congregate together in less orderly
conventions and have heard from them far more expressions
of contempt for our government and its laws than
these men uttered. The truth was that the gentlemen
whom I now had the honor to meet were more fervently patriotic
than any similar assemblage I had ever seen. Men
who come together in the name of a church, a party, a bank,
a business enterprise or even a particular charity, are not
prone to hold country above all other objects. But these
men, gathering in the name of humanity, held their country
to be, by reason of its location, character, condition and
opportunities, the most suitable field for whatever was and
is best in the human race.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the meeting opened Thompson, who was evidently
held in great esteem, assumed the position of presiding
officer. He began with a brief statement of its purposes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gentlemen,” said he, “this meeting is called for a purpose
with which you are doubtless all familiar. Lest there
should be persons among you, however, who are not fully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>informed, I deem it proper to make a brief statement at this
time. The present business and financial depression,
spreading as it does throughout most of Christendom, has
produced a feeling of unrest among those classes of people
who feel it most. This unrest is admitted by all who have
eyes with which to observe, and minds with which to analyze,
to be fraught with danger. It threatens our security,
it threatens our homes, it threatens morals and religion, it
threatens the stability of our institutions, the existence of
the republic and the durability of Christian civilization.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is the protest of blind Samson against the exactions
of the Philistines. It is the human heart overflowing with
bitterness at the injustice of men and classes. Ere the pillars
of the temple tremble and the walls of the temple fall
upon us, we offer a remedy and ask that it be applied. In
justice to ourselves, let me say, that we propose this remedy
experimentally. We do not, by any means, know whether
the human system is capable of receiving it, but we are absolutely
certain that it can do no injury. We are also
equally certain that the attempt to apply it will improve
the condition of those who actively participate in our plan.
I ought also to say that if our remedy is accepted and applied
with earnestness and intelligence it will not fail.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are in the American states over 200,000 voters
who believe that the true theory of economics is that the
machinery of production belongs to the people in common.
These are convinced that in the theory so expressed lies the
remedy for those economic evils which produce the extremes
of great poverty and great wealth. They are also
ready to participate in some concerted movement which
will enable them to establish a Co-operative Commonwealth
in one of our American states. Our plan is to
direct all those who believe in this system of economics
into one state, enable them to establish themselves there
in comparative comfort and ultimately, by colonizing a
sufficient number of them, to take possession of the political
machinery of that state, adopt a new constitution
and through it establish the Co-operative Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“We who have enlisted in this enterprise believe that our
own grand republic, with its system of interdependent yet
sovereign states, offers the field for an experiment and an
example which may enlighten the world. The example of
Utah, although disapproved as to its purpose, presents an
instance of a commonwealth developing under the influence
of an idea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the idea is pure and exalted, and at the same time
furnishes hope to hungry and struggling millions, how
much more likely is it to develop a masterpiece among
states.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Co-operative Commonwealth is already organized.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It even now numbers 3,000 votes, representing 15,000
people—men, women and children—in its membership.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A fund of $100,000 has been accumulated and is now
available to establish co-operative colonies and is rapidly
increasing. No colonies, it is true, have been established,
for the reason that we have not yet selected the state for
that purpose. This selection is the special purpose of our
meeting to-night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me express to you, my friends, the belief that we are
now meeting in the most important convention which we
have ever held, because our success depends undeniably
upon the proper location of our Co-operative Commonwealth.
Strong arguments can be produced in favor of the
South and the West, and I have heard more favorable mention
of Tennessee than of any of the states. I hope, gentlemen,
that you will discuss this matter fully and deliberately
as becomes the dignity and high purpose of men who, perhaps,
are about to give to the world its most enduring and
most beneficent commonwealth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So the meeting was declared open for discussion. The
gentlemen who participated were not partisans of any particular
section or state and were evidently disposed to be
deliberate and cautious in their selection. Most of them
presented arguments in favor of Tennessee. Some were in
favor of the state of Washington. As I listened to the discussion
I was conscious of a deep feeling of interest developing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>within me. It seemed to me that intuitively I comprehended
the motives and purposes of these men and that
I had a stronger grasp upon the details of their design than
they. A great inspiration seized upon me which seemed to
swing my mind over every detail and to light up every feature
of this subject. When all who intended appeared to
have spoken, the chairman suggested that Mr. Braden
might, perhaps, present some views which would be worthy
of consideration. I could not forbear compliance and spoke
as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gentlemen—I feel a deep and profound sympathy for
the objects of this meeting. When I say this I do not want
to be understood as expressing favor for any plan whereby
the thoughtful, conservative statesmanship of modern society
is to be set aside, and experimental statesmanship is to
be substituted for it. I am convinced that the social system
which Christendom accepts to-day is the best which humanity
has ever employed, and that it would be the worst of
crimes to destroy it without furnishing some practical
model for a new and better one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The United States presents a plan which is sufficiently
elastic, an area sufficiently extensive, and opportunities
sufficiently varied and abundant, to make it proper that one
state should be devoted to the development of the co-operative
system. I, for one, am fully convinced that a state
should be selected in which the obstacles to your efforts will
be but few and slight. For instance, you ought not to concentrate
your efforts on Tennessee if there is another area,
less populous, less prejudiced and less attached to the present
system.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The vote of Tennessee is 321,190. Its population approaches
2,000,000. You must, in order to gain control of
Tennessee, increase its population by nearly 2,000,000 co-operators
casting a vote of nearly 300,000. This assumes
that a portion of the present population is not opposed to
the Co-operative Commonwealth. It is plain to me that it
will take you a generation to accomplish your purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The same objections apply in a less degree to Washington.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The population of that state is 450,000 and its vote
93,435. To direct our colonies to a territory not yet admitted
into the Union, like Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma,
would subject them to repressive congressional legislation
from which in a state they would be free. As for
Wyoming, with a population of 60,000 and a vote of
21,000, it does not present a field for our operations as suitable
as some others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For my part I am greatly prepossessed in favor of Idaho.
It has an area of about 86,000 square miles, a population of
about 90,000 and a vote of about 30,000. Its vote is now
increased by, probably, 15,000 on account of the extension
of the right of suffrage of women. This will be an advantage
to your colonists, because the proportion of married
men among you will be greater than that of the shifting
population of the mining camps. It is evident that you will
control the state as soon as you have 50,000 men and women
there. Already the Co-operative Commonwealth numbers
3,000 men and this means 6,000 votes. But I make no
doubt that 100,000 men, to say nothing of their wives, are
ready to go to Idaho with your colonies if you choose that
location.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you ask, what manner of place is Idaho? I reply,
that in my journeyings throughout my beloved country I
have found its superior nowhere in what goes to produce a
great commonwealth. Its name signifies ‘Light on the
Mountains.’ It has valleys of great breadth and fertility,
mountains covered with extensive forests, lakes of enchanting
beauty, navigable rivers, swift streams, unlimited water
power, inexhaustible mineral resources.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It has 12,000,000 acres of land which can be reclaimed
by irrigation and made lavishly productive, and there is
plenty of water available for the purpose. It has seven
million acres of forest lands. You, perhaps, have no very
great acquaintance with Idaho. This, in my opinion,
should induce you to select a committee to visit the state
incognito to examine and report on its resources. You will
find that it is capable of supporting a population of 10,000,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>people. These can engage in manufacture, farming,
grazing, fruit culture, mining, wool growing and all the
pursuits followed by the people of Pennsylvania or New
England. The climate is not so warm as that of Tennessee,
but in my judgment that is an advantage. It is much warmer
than in any northern state east of the Rockies and north
of the Ohio river. It is dry and healthful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gentlemen, I shall not enter into a further description
of Idaho, but beg you to make an investigation. Remember
that in states whose opportunities are famous those opportunities
have been occupied. If you can find a state which
is but little known you will find its opportunities, open for
you to take possession of and control. Idaho is such a
state.”</p>

<p class='c008'>My remarks produced a deep impression. I was followed
by several gentlemen who heartily approved the suggestion
to appoint a committee of investigation and to send the
committee to Idaho, to report after a month’s absence. A
motion to that effect was carried providing that the chairman
and two others, to be appointed by him, should constitute
that committee. The chairman did me the honor to
appoint me, and also appointed Henry B. Henderson, a gentleman
of great wealth, a reformer of thirty years’ standing,
and one of the truest and best men who ever graced the
planet with an unselfish life. The assembly then adjourned
to meet again a month after, when the committee was to
make its report.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE COMMISSION REPORTS AND IDAHO IS SELECTED—COLONY NUMBER ONE PREPARES TO ENTER THE LAND OF ITS CHOICE—THE JOURNEY TO HUNTINGTON, OREGON, AND INCIDENTS AT THAT PLACE—ON TO DEER VALLEY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The commission to investigate the resources of Idaho
performed their labors conscientiously and after an absence
of about a month made such a report as determined our
people to choose Idaho for the home of the society. This
important detail being settled, it was decided to send Colony
Number One into the field as speedily as possible. The
commission had recommended a valley through which ran
a small stream into Snake river as a suitable location. It
was a beautiful valley, about twenty-five miles in length
and from a quarter of one to five miles wide. The stream
flowing from the high mountains near its source had never
been known to fail, and poured its torrents with ceaseless
power into the flood at its mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mountains rose only a short distance from its banks
for ten miles along its course, but when it emerged from the
foot hills the broad and fertile acres spread away on both
sides until they reached the top of rich divides. In the
mountains along its border grew great forests of yellow pine
and gold and silver abounded. Gold had also been mined
in placers all along the valley, and was still found in greater
or less quantity. The soil was as rich as that of the Nile,
and everywhere in the wild state the grasses grew luxuriant
and nutritious.</p>

<p class='c008'>The climate, we learned, was all that could be desired.
Surrounded by high mountains and plateaus and nestling
in the depths of an immense depression, extreme climatic
changes were unknown. The winters were as mild as those
of Southern Ohio and the Chinook winds from the warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Pacific currents breathed over this region, now and then,
the balmy sympathy of southern climes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colony Number One was fully organized with John
Thompson as President, Henderson as Treasurer and myself
as Secretary. The number of our members was then
three hundred. We were not limited by any law or rule as
to our membership, but had decided to accept no more applications
until we were fully established in our western
home. It was arranged that fifty men should go to the selected
location and make the necessary preparations for the
colony. Thompson, Henderson and myself were included.
The other forty-seven were made up of mechanics, farmers
and lumbermen.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were six farmers, six lumber and sawmill men,
six carpenters, three masons, three stonecutters, three expert
sheep men, three expert cattle men, three merchants,
one physician, one blacksmith, one horseshoer, and eleven
who, although men of intelligence and able to adapt themselves
to all kinds of work, were not trained to any special
calling. These fifty paid into the colony treasury one hundred
dollars each; fifty others, who were expected to follow
us in three months, paid in twenty-five dollars; fifty more
paid fifteen dollars; fifty others paid ten dollars, and the
remainder five. All these were to continue payments at
the same rate monthly until the entrance fee of one hundred
dollars was paid, when the member would become entitled
to enter the colony as an active colonist. We found
ourselves possessed, then, on the day of our departure, of
eight thousand five hundred dollars, paid in by members,
and the Brotherhood throughout the United States loaned
us ten thousand dollars from its accumulated fund, to be
repaid in three years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our faith and credit, as honest men, were the only security
the Brotherhood required. Each man paid his own fare
and traveling expenses until we reached Huntington, in
Eastern Oregon. From that point until we arrived at our
destination all expenses were to be borne in common and
defrayed from the common fund.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>It was agreed that until the colony was entirely established,
and its business had reached a tolerably settled condition,
John Thompson should have larger powers than the
presidential office conferred upon him. This was done because
it was thought the exigencies and uncertainties of
the situation demanded his varied experience and the exercise
of his quick judgment and large executive force. We
regarded him as a sort of military chief, although we were
as little like a military band as it would be possible to conceive.
He naturally assumed the leadership and we naturally
submitted to it. The better to direct our movements
he divided us into squads of six, putting the carpenters into
a squad numbered one, and directing them to choose a foreman;
the masons and stonecutters together numbered two;
the sheep and cattle men numbered three; the lumber and
sawmill men numbered four; the merchants, blacksmith,
horseshoer and one commoner numbered five; the farmers
numbered six; six commoners numbered seven; Henderson,
myself and four commoners, all of the latter being educated
men, one an ex-editor, one an ex-clergyman and one
an assayer and chemist and another a surveyor and ex-real
estate man, numbered eight. The physician was not included
in any squad but was, as we facetiously declared,
to constitute a squad by himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>May 1st, 1897, we took our departure from Chicago for
our future home, and proceeding over the Union Pacific
arrived at Huntington in due time. Disembarking here,
we went into camp on the outskirts of the little town and
commenced the purchase of our necessary outfit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before leaving Chicago we had purchased and caused to
be shipped to us a stock of groceries, hardware, a limited
quantity of dry goods, drugs, paints, a number of ploughs,
harrows and farm and mining tools and tools for our
mechanics, a portable sawmill and eight farm wagons at
a cost of nine thousand dollars in all. These were all at
Huntington when we arrived. But we were without live
stock, horses or seed. Thompson, who had been conceded
the title of captain, assigned to each squad its duty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Number One received orders to take charge of one wagon
and load the same with such tools as carpenters required,
and if any room was left over to report to him. Number
Two assumed charge of a second wagon with similar instructions.
Number Three did the same with the third
wagon, but was also directed to purchase, in the surrounding
country, ten milch cows, a herd of one hundred
and fifty cattle and one thousand sheep. Number Four
was instructed to take one wagon and in addition to provide
for the transportation of the portable sawmill. Numbers
Five, Six, Seven and Eight were each assigned to a
wagon, and Thompson, with the aid of two members of
Number Six, who were excellent horsemen, undertook the
purchase of the horses.</p>

<p class='c008'>We sojourned in the neighborhood of Huntington a
week. At the end of that time our company was prepared
to move. We had purchased a quantity of seed for two
hundred dollars, sixteen draft horses at a cost of eight
hundred dollars, and forty-two saddle horses at a cost of
eight hundred and forty dollars. We had acquired our
milch cows for two hundred dollars, one hundred and
fifty cattle for two thousand dollars and a flock of sheep
numbering one thousand for fifteen hundred dollars, and
there remained four thousand dollars in our treasury.</p>

<p class='c008'>The road from Huntington was quite familiar to “The
Captain” and myself. Both of us, but at different periods,
had spent considerable time in the vicinity of Huntington
and had explored along Snake river and its tributaries for
gold. We were able, therefore, to point out a suitable road
and as we proceeded upon our journey we encountered no
obstacles except when we found it necessary to cross Snake
river.</p>

<p class='c008'>This obstacle only served to delay us a short time, there
being at that point a ferry which we employed to take us
across. Once in Idaho our people seemed to acquire new
life. Everything was full of interest. We made no effort
to march in any regular system except that the squad
wagons followed each other in numerical order, the bull
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>train, which had been hired to transport the portable sawmill,
following somewhat slowly far in the rear. The
men in charge of the machinery were residents of Huntington
and well acquainted with the road to our destination,
which was then known as Deer Valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>As we moved along we found the country settled, but
somewhat sparsely. Here and there a rancher came out
to salute us and, learning of our intention to settle in
Idaho, bade us a hearty welcome. Sometimes we fell in
with cowboys in charge of herds of cattle, and passed
through several camps of miners who worked the placers
along Snake river. Several of these latter were composed
of Chinese and their workings were referred to by the white
miners in other camps as “Chinese Diggings.” We observed
that everywhere the soil was rich but lacking in
moisture except where irrigation was employed. The
grasses, although the season was early, were luxuriant and
the cattle, which had wintered without shelter, were in
remarkably good condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several of the large ranches were among the most beautiful
I had ever seen. One of these, comprising about five
hundred acres, was located where a swift stream, called
Conner creek, flowed into Snake river. This stream had
been tapped at a high elevation and the waters diverted,
by means of a flume, to the rich alluvial lands below.
There a system of small ditches distributed the waters
among orchards of peaches, apples, pears, plums, nectarines
and apricots and among vineyards of grapes and beds
of strawberries. The rancher who had charge of this
wonderful little domain, a portly old man, full of information,
affable and communicative, assured me that he had
traveled the world over but had never beheld a fairer spot
than this. “But,” said he, “Idaho is filled with such
places.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I asked him about the markets and he candidly informed
me that he had been unable to garner and ship his fruits,
lacking funds for that purpose, but that he had sold his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>vegetables at a good profit in the neighboring mining
camps. He also showed us a large quantity of dried fruit
which his son had cut and prepared and which there was
a market for in the same camps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But,” he said, “I have not found the South to be as
profitable for farming as this locality, because if their market
is more extensive it is also far cheaper. At the outset
the advantage is with us. Our grain, hay, hogs and vegetables
are all readily disposed of and command a good
price among the gold mines.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such incidents, and the sublime scenery which everywhere
presented itself to our delighted vision, varied the
monotony of our journey so that the three days spent on
the way after crossing Snake river seemed to pass like a
dream. We arrived at Deer Valley without any accident of
a serious nature, full of hope, in the best of health and
eager to begin the work of laying, as it were, the corner-stone
of the Co-operative Commonwealth.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>DEER VALLEY—THE FOUNDING AND NAMING OF CO-OPOLIS—THOMPSON’S AND EDMUNDS’ VIEWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was about noon on the 20th day of May, 1897, that our
company entered Deer Valley. We found a very good road
leading up into the mountains along the south bank of
the stream and followed that without difficulty. The
captain, taking six of our horsemen, including myself,
went ahead of the rest of the company, who followed after
more slowly with the wagons and live stock. The sawmill
machinery was nearly a day’s journey behind them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The captain’s purpose was to select a suitable site for a
camp which would in all probability be more permanent
than we had yet made. He was quite familiar with Deer
Valley, as I have already stated, and had in mind a
location which on other occasions he had marked as an
excellent place in which to build a city. In a short time
we arrived at this place and commenced an examination
of the surroundings. We all readily agreed that the captain’s
judgment was good and, after viewing the land from
many points, unanimously decided to recommend it to
our company as a proper place to establish our camp.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were about four miles from Snake river. The valley
at this point was somewhat over five miles wide, walled in
by table lands on either side. These table lands were
high elevations with level summits covering many square
miles of fertile but dry lands. They sloped from the
summits through a succession of three shelves, each quite
level, down toward the valley, and thence the valley inclined
gently toward the river bed. The stream itself
flowed at the bottom of a deep gully and its banks were
prettily fringed with box elder trees. The table lands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>their sloping sides, the shelves and the broad area of the
valley down to the fringe of box elder trees, presented
at this season of the year a beautiful sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>All was dressed in the verdure of the rich grasses which
make the highlands and lowlands of Idaho famous as
the grazing grounds of those great herds of cattle which
abundantly assist in feeding the world. There were a
few trees in places on the slopes of the highlands, and a
hillock which was proposed as the location of our camp,
contained quite a grove. But except for these, and the
fringe of box elders along the river bank, the entire area
was quite open. The stream at this time came tumbling
down the valley at a furious rate, the incline being quite
pronounced. Looking up the valley we saw the giant
mountains on whose majestic tops the snow remained
unmelted, and whose lower sides were black with the
foliage of the forest of yellow pine.</p>

<p class='c008'>We found here a rancher who claimed to be the owner
of some three hundred and twenty acres of land which he
had attempted to reclaim by means of a rather crude
irrigating ditch which conducted the water of the stream
from a point above to a portion of his ground. He claimed
also to have washed some gold from the sand taken from
the bed of the creek. The man had lived in the valley for
ten years, but was evidently neither a man of enterprise
nor much intelligence. He had once possessed a considerable
herd, but had lost it at the gaming table in some
of the camps, and was poor and anxious to get away into
the “diggings” up in the mountains. He was able to give
some information of value to us, and offered to sell us the
ranch and about a hundred acres of land which he held
under the placer mining laws of the United States, for
two dollars an acre.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were occupied in making these observations when,
about two hours after our arrival, the wagons and their
escort reached a point on the road near the house (it was
scarcely more than a hut) of the old rancher. The captain
and myself immediately rode over and directions were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>given to proceed to the hillock, where the grove of young
trees already mentioned offered an inviting shelter, and go
into camp. Accordingly the entire company went thither,
the teams were unharnessed, the horses were picketed,
some tents were pitched and the men were soon to be seen
engaged in conversation in little groups, some standing on
elevations which offered a commanding view, others moving
to various parts of the valley, and others still, lying
down and making observations while they rested. The
farmers were particularly industrious, looking over old
Hacket’s ranch.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the afternoon of this memorable first day wore to its
close the men all returned to camp, where those to whom
the duty of preparing meals had been assigned had prepared
a feast somewhat more elaborate than usual, and
one of them reminded us that this was the first feast on
the site of our new town and that the anniversary of this
day would hereafter be a feast day for years to come. The
prophecy was hailed with approval and the evening was
given up to feasting and speaking, just as has been customary
on this anniversary ever since.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the meal was finished we gathered together under
one of the largest trees in the grove and called upon those
who were known to be speakers to address us. Among
others the company called on me and I proposed that, as
we were to have a city, whether it be established on the
spot or in some other place, and as our city must have a
name, that we proceed to give it a name forthwith. To
this one of the company, Albert Ortz, a German, objected,
for the reason that our sheep and cattle men, as well as four
of our commoners, being in charge of the herds which had
not yet arrived, ought to be allowed to take part. To this
I replied that our action would not be binding, if we
selected a name, and we could regard the selection now as
merely informal. This was satisfactory and Ortz withdrew
his objection. I then called for names to be voted on.
Three only were submitted. Alpha, because it was the first
of its kind; Co-opolis, the city of co-operators, and Omega,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>which Dr. Pinder proposed, because, he said rather facetiously,
our co-operative city was about the last hope which
labor had left for justice in this world. The vote was then
taken and resulted in a large majority for Co-opolis. It
is as well to say here that afterward our absent members
voted unanimously to approve this name, and the city was
so christened.</p>

<p class='c008'>While this was going on the captain had said nothing
and, I observed, did not even vote. He had been sitting
somewhat apart from the rest of the company with a half-pleased
but yet serious look upon his face. I had come to
understand him very well, and knew that he felt grave
apprehensions for the success of this movement, and now I
made no doubt that he was feeling the responsibility which
rested upon each member of the colony.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Brothers,” said I, “I notice that our captain is serious
when he should be gay. I, for one, vote that the captain
give an account of himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Everybody called for the captain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My brothers,” said he, in response, “I regret that you
have called upon me to speak, because the thoughts which
press for expression are not altogether in harmony with
the gayety of our present festivities. I am sure that none
rejoices more than I do for the safe arrival of our party in
this beautiful valley. But my mind is not with to-day nor
yesterday, but dwells with the future. The project which
has brought us here is, in the light of all history, an exceedingly
ambitious one. Failure, it is true, cannot result
injuriously, but success will be a beacon light of hope to
those many millions of men and women who are denied
access to nature’s countless bounties.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You, my brothers, have wives and children who will
follow you ere long into this fair country. For you, as
individuals, the world is opening out its avenues of comfort,
but upon each of us here rests a responsibility such as
few men have ever assumed. We are here not merely to
benefit ourselves, but to benefit, by the force of example,
the waiting and watching world.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Co-operative enterprises have been successful in many
commercial and mechanical pursuits. As a rule such enterprises
have failed so far as land and its cultivation are
concerned. But there is no apparent reason why they
should be less successful than are the enterprises of commerce
and manufacture. Our purpose is to combine all
laborious or productive occupations. Behold, my brothers,
this beautiful valley! God has secreted in almost every
inch of its soil the gift of productivity. Yonder the mountains
tower above us. God has made the forest to yield fuel
and lumber for our use. High up on the white-capped
summits and deep down in the cool cisterns of nature are
the sources of these waters which flow in the rushing torrent,
and which we may direct thither to moisten this soil.
On the table lands which rise north and south of us our
herds and flocks shall graze.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can see, my brothers, that if we fail in our enterprise
the fault will be in us and not in nature. The duty
which lies before us is to work in harmony. We must
encourage competition in all lines of mental, physical and
spiritual progress. But we must rid ourselves of competition
in the simple acquisition of property. We must encourage
individualism in all that makes men practical, self-reliant
and manly. We must destroy it in all that makes
men grasping and unsympathetic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My brothers, the great world beyond deems that man
greatest who acquires the greatest fortune or wields the
greatest power, but I say to you that man is greatest who
induces the greatest number of men and women to do
right. Such is the manhood we must honor, and upon the
brow of such we shall place the laurel wreath of victory.
If we work to such a purpose we shall succeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My brothers, the most difficult part of our project
lies in our foundation work. We will meet obstacles.
Some of our number may, perhaps, be of opinion that
the first year or two of our struggle here should be free
from difficulty because our ideal is high. If so it were better
that those immediately return to their eastern homes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>because there is nothing for us, the pioneers of the Co-operative
Commonwealth, but arduous labor. Your wives
and children look forward to a time when they may come
hither to homes which you have established where the old
system which has forced you into this unsettled country
cannot affect them. What will you do? Will you subjugate
self, defer to one another’s opinions, and work always
together, and so make your enterprise succeed? I believe
you will.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My brothers, this work is in your hands. I have been
your leader thus far, but I now surrender the leadership and
insist that the will of the majority be your guide hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Thompson ceased to speak some seconds elapsed
before any one ventured to break silence. His words were
fully appreciated and it was evident that all comprehended
the magnitude of the task which was before them. Mr.
Edmunds, ex-clergyman, voiced the general sentiment
of all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are not alone, Brother Thompson,” said he, “in
your apprehensions. Most of us entertain the same doubts
as to the future which you have expressed. But it is better
it should be so than that we should, in such an enterprise,
be carried away by enthusiasm. When soldiers approach
the dangers of war, where death and glory mingle,
their captain seeks to inspire them with a courage which
dares but does not reason. No need of that with us. The
task we have to accomplish is, in truth, devoid of danger.
It is the easiest ever proposed to the intelligence of man.
All that we need lies where God placed it centuries ago, and
is ours, if only we will take it. If we make this task hard,
it is because we will not reason. If dangers arise, they will
not arise from the mountain, stream or valley, nor yet from
yonder table lands nor grassy slopes. They will arise from
ourselves. This we must study to avoid. This is our work.
One thing, my brothers, we must do from the outset. Let
our community be self-dependent. Let us call upon the
outside world to help us as little as possible. Let us
build our own homes, burn our own lime, manufacture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>our own furniture and crockery. Let us make it a rule
that whatever we can make ourselves, no matter how
much labor it costs us, that we will make. If we do this and
work together success is certain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The clergyman spoke for nearly half an hour and finished
amid great enthusiasm, for his speech was able and
brilliant and calculated to produce confidence in our enterprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>This ended the memorable first day.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE GENERAL SYSTEM—PROGRESS THE FIRST YEAR—LAND TITLES—LABOR ORDERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The city of Co-opolis was established, after the surrounding
region was duly explored, upon the site of our first camp
in Deer Valley. The Hacket ranch and water rights were
acquired by our company at a small expense, the farmers
went to work upon it immediately and in a comparatively
short time we had many acres of land broken and planted.
We sowed very little wheat the first year, but made a specialty
of corn, calculating that we could feed it to our cattle
and hogs, and believing that we could realize more from our
live stock than from the raising and sale of wheat. We
also planted vegetables of all kinds in quantities which we
believed would not only suffice for our company for the
following winter, but would enable us to dispose of a surplus
in the mining camps in the mountains.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ex-surveyor, meanwhile, proceeded to lay out a
town. This was a very simple task, as our plan was to
construct a public hall and office building in the center of
a large square, surround the latter by a wide street, and
erect our store, hotel and residences on this street. If the
city grew it was considered that we had ample space at our
command. Meanwhile the sawmill had arrived and had
been conveyed to a place on the banks of the stream and
placed in charge of the sawmill men. One of these having
great experience in the forests of Wisconsin, took a number
of picked commoners and went to the headwaters of the
stream in the mountains and was soon able to send a large
quantity of pine logs down the current, where they were
caught and sawed into lumber of various dimensions.
In three weeks after we started our camp our carpenters
had built a temporary frame store building, a rather crude
hotel and had supplied these with furniture which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>rather crude and unfinished but sufficient for our purposes.
It was not considered prudent to erect any permanent
structures until our lumber should become better seasoned,
but carpenters, masons and stonecutters proceeded to excavate
for the fifty cottages which we designed to construct
for our members and their families. In the latter part of
June, such was our industry, we had a very respectable appearing
village, with carpenter and blacksmith shops and
general store. The last was the feature of the village, containing
a stock of hardware, dry goods and groceries and
a stock of drugs of various kinds. The hotel furnished
board and lodging to all our company.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after our arrival at Co-opolis, at a series of meetings
held for that purpose, we had formed our permanent
organization, taken as our name “The Co-opolitan Association”
and adopted a constitution and by-laws to regulate
our colony.</p>

<p class='c008'>The constitution dealt only with the system of government
and invested the lawmaking body, which it created,
with unlimited powers as to all other matters.</p>

<p class='c008'>The President was to hold office for seven years and was
ineligible to re-election.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Vice-President was elected for the same period.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first President and Vice-President were elected by
all active members, and any member was eligible, but after
seven years these officers must be elected from among
heads of departments only.</p>

<p class='c008'>Heads of departments were to be denominated chiefs and
were to be chosen by popular vote from among foremen
and the latter by the Legislative Council.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lawmaking power was to consist of the heads of
departments and President and Vice-President, the former
presiding at all legislative meetings and the latter, by
virtue of his office, being a member of the Legislative
Council with the right to speak and vote on all propositions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whenever twenty per cent of the men and women of
the Association should petition the Legislative Council to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>declare any office vacant it was bound to submit the question
as to whether such vacancy should be so declared to
popular vote, and if a majority decided in the affirmative
then the Council must declare it. The incumbent whose
office or position was thus vacated was not eligible again
for the remainder of his unexpired term and the full term
following.</p>

<p class='c008'>Officers found guilty by the Council of misfeasance or
malfeasance in office were also subject to impeachment by
the Council, who were required to pass on the particular
charges submitted to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The legislative and judicial functions were both conferred
upon the Legislative Council, and this body could
initiate and complete legislation, but on petition of twenty
per cent of all voters proposing a new law the Legislative
Council was required to submit such law to popular vote
and the decision of a majority of such voters operated as
either an enactment or repeal. This action was effectual
to permanently dispose of such law for five years. The
constitution was also subject to revision, correction, amendment
or repeal by the same method.</p>

<p class='c008'>The constitution further provided that every person
under twenty years of age should be in charge of the department
of education, that no man or woman should in
any event be required to work more than twenty-five years,
but that after having contributed twenty-five years’ labor
should become entitled to his full share of the profits distributed
annually among members.</p>

<p class='c008'>This constitution did not limit the right of the people
to shorten the term of service if they so desired. It was
deemed expedient to provide for two classes of industrials,
wage workers and members. The former were such as
were employed and paid reasonable wages. These were
rarely employed except in cases of emergency. The latter
were such as had paid an entrance fee and had been accepted
as equal partners in the enterprise. The wage
workers were such as enlisted in the Industrial Army for
pay and they could not participate in the affairs of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>society or settlement. But any one of these who was in
good health and of sound mind could become a member
on payment of the fee required and on enlisting in the
Industrial Army subject to the laws of the society.</p>

<p class='c008'>No person was admitted who was over fifty-five years of
age except such person was able to contribute to the Association’s
accumulated wealth an amount of property equal
to the full annual dividend of the average member at the
time of his application, multiplied by the number of years’
service required by members. In later years, as is well
known, the constitution does not admit an applicant who
is over forty except on the same terms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The constitution was by no means a perfect one at the
outset, but it was sufficiently elastic and stable in its provisions
to admit of such amendments, without danger to its
substantial features, as might, from time to time, be suggested
by experience.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most conservative force in society has been found to
be, not the wise nor the foolish, but the majority which are
neither the one or the other. These are not generally favorable
to experimental legislation, and long before the
establishment of the Co-operative Commonwealth Switzerland
proved, by the operation of the Initiative and Referendum
provisions of their constitution, that the people
were disposed to accept changes in their social system with
a caution that made progress slow, but retrogression impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first year of the Co-operative Commonwealth was
a very successful one. We had May 1st, 1898, over one
thousand persons, including men, women and children, in
our city of Co-opolis, two hundred and fifty substantial
cottages, an excellent public hall, a good hotel, a large and
sightly three-story building containing our department
store, postoffice and offices for our President, Vice-President
and heads of departments; an excellent schoolhouse
with graded school and a corps of eight teachers, consisting
of our ex-clergyman, who became first principal, and teachers
who were selected from among the wives of members.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>All the furniture used in our homes and buildings at this
time was manufactured of such lumber as we had and was
somewhat crude, but sufficient in all respects. In our department
store were sold vegetables produced by us, consisting
of potatoes, onions, beets, parsnips and all of the
hardy variety grown on the old time “breaking” on Hacket’s
ranch. We had home-made preserves and a quantity of
dried fruit. The meat department was well supplied from
our own herds of cattle or from the surrounding country,
and from our flocks of sheep, which had largely increased,
partly through natural causes and partly because much of
the money received for membership fees had been invested
in that direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after we had definitely settled upon a site for
Co-opolis we proceeded to acquire land. This whole valley
was what in the United States land office was denominated
“desert land,” not because it was barren but because it was
unproductive unless reclaimed by irrigation. Under the
law it was permitted that each man enter three hundred
and twenty acres upon declaring his intention to reclaim
the same, and we had in this manner entered, up to June
1st, some sixteen thousand acres.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had also, for the purpose of complying with the law
and completing our titles, proceeded to a point about ten
miles up the stream, and had there constructed a dam, collecting
the waters of the stream by that means, and were
engaged, whenever the weather permitted, in excavating
ditches, or building flumes so as to conduct a large quantity
of water nearly the whole length of the valley, but high up
on the slopes of the “tables” on the south. The work was
by no means finished, but it was easily estimated that when
our plant was completed over eighty thousand acres of land
would be available for agricultural purposes. That was on
one side of the river. Our plans also included the irrigation
of the north side of the river in the same manner. The
law was such that, being the owners of Hacket’s water
right, and having tapped the stream at a time that no other
settlers could be disturbed or interfered with, we were entitled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>to the exclusive control of the stream. We found
that the law required us to file our claims to this
water right for record in the office of the Register of
Deeds for the county, and did so accordingly. It was not
difficult for any one of our number to see that we were in a
position to shut out all settlers in this valley who were not
members. The water right was taken in the names of
Thompson, myself, Henderson, Ortz and three others, who
constituted our first Legislative Council, as trustees for the
Association. If any member who entered the land thought
to segregate his tract ultimately from the great body of
land he had only to consider that it was entirely worthless
without irrigation, and that this was exclusively controlled
by the Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Industrial Army at this time numbered five hundred,
one hundred and fifty being women and three hundred
and fifty men. The women were engaged largely in
the Domestic department, but a number were employed
in the departments of Commerce and Education. One of
the merchants had charge of the department store, but
most of the clerical help was selected from among the
women. The bookkeepers were, at that time, all women.
The chief of the Domestic department was a woman and as
such participated in all our legislative councils. The entire
army was divided into companies of twenty, and at the
head of each company was a foreman. Each company was
again divided into two squads of ten and each squad had a
second or assistant foreman. In forming companies or
squads our chiefs endeavored to have the members composed,
as nearly as possible, of men having the same or kindred
trades. We now had three physicians, one of whom
was regarded as an especially skillful surgeon. We also had
an incipient brass band which assisted largely in rendering
the hours of recreation pleasant.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this time we had a rapidly increasing trade at our
store and were supplying many of the camps with such
goods as they needed. Two of our own wagons were constantly
employed in conveying groceries, hardware and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>other ware to our customers in the mountains, and it was
not an uncommon thing for five or six wagons to come
down in the course of a day for goods. The enterprise was
successful and the prices which we obtained for what we
sold were very profitable. We were obliged, however, to
constantly replenish our stock of groceries, dry goods, hardware
and drugs from the east. We also sold large quantities
of beef in the mountains and, not caring to draw too
heavily on our own herds for this demand, we kept a number
of men constantly employed hunting and purchasing
animals suitable for the purpose. We also devoted a building
to the sick and our hospital was already quite famous
throughout the entire region. Men in the camps who were
injured or who had become sick preferred to endure the
journey to Co-opolis to avail themselves of our physicians
and nurses rather than risk the rough and sometimes reckless
treatment to which they were elsewhere exposed. Our
hotel, store and hospital were sources of profit which aided
us largely the first and second years of our career.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most difficult problems which we had to solve
the first year was that of providing a medium of exchange
for the use of our own members and also such persons as we
might employ. We recognized that, although the money of
society was at variance and inconsistent with all our plans,
until we had fully established the Co-operative Commonwealth
and acquired the state and all it contained, it would
be impossible to establish a labor-check system. We decided
that money was to be treated as a mere commodity
and purchased as such, just as potatoes, wheat or beef were
purchased. In dealing with the world outside of our society
we must have money until we should become independent
of it. It was on that theory that we endeavored to
keep our fund of United States currency increasing.</p>

<p class='c008'>How to deal among ourselves was the question. We were
satisfied that members should, as nearly as possible, receive
equal shares of what was produced in our colony, provided
they were industrious and worked honestly, but we deemed
that in the formative period of the commonwealth it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>inexpedient to adopt the check system of Bellamy’s social
plan exclusively. We did, however, decide that checks
should be given to those who desired them, but that, owing
to the fact that many of our workers were to be, at the
outset, mere hired men, it would be better to issue
orders for each one’s share as measured by dollars. The
laws of the United States practically denied us the right to
issue money or circulating notes, and our purpose was to
build our state in entire harmony with the constitution.
We proposed to avoid a conflict with the Federal government.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was therefore decided that each member should receive
wages, to be established upon the basis of a distribution of
sixty per cent of all the society produced, equally divided
among all persons above the age of twenty-one, whether
male or female.</p>

<p class='c008'>The forty per cent undistributed was to be used to purchase
money for the use of the department store; in other
words, sold for cash. These wages were to be paid in
orders on the treasurer, signed by the president. They were
required to read as follows: “To the Treasurer of the Co-opolitan
Association: Deliver to John Jenkins, Foreman
of Company Number One of the Industrial Army, one (or
any denomination) dollar’s worth of any product, convenience,
privilege or license at your disposal. Signed, John
Thompson, President.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These orders were to be delivered to the foreman only
and it was the foreman’s duty to endorse or stamp his name
on the back so that, when once so endorsed or stamped, they
became current as a medium of exchange, but not as a measure
of value. The foreman’s duty was to pay his men with
these orders and he was held to the strictest account for the
disposition made of each order. Whenever an order was
received in any department it was stamped canceled and
never again issued. Most of our members for the first three
years preferred the check. As time passed, however, the
credit labor check became more and more popular and in
time crowded out the circulating orders entirely.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>CO-OPOLIS A CONVENTION CITY—A MENACE TO LIBERTY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was a bright day in the latter part of June, 1902, that
the first state convention of the Co-operative Commonwealth
met in our city of Co-opolis to place in nomination
a full state ticket for the state of Idaho. It was considered
that the co-operators were strong enough to take possession
of the political machinery of the state. The National
Brotherhood, using Co-opolis as a basis for its operations in
the state, had directed many colonies to Co-opolis and we
had taken charge of them as they came, absorbed most of
them in our own Industrial Army, and others we had assisted
to establish themselves in some fertile valley in the
state where they could put their own peculiar ideas and
methods of co-operation into practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>We now had fifty thousand male and female voters, upon
whose solid support we could count to carry out our designs.
Most of this population was settled through the
southern, central and western part of the state, and there
were at least forty cities and villages entirely devoted to our
cause. Co-opolis contained a population of fifteen thousand
souls—men, women and children. Its Industrial
Army was 7,000 strong, and its members, working not more
than seven hours a day, accomplished the most remarkable
results.</p>

<p class='c008'>Co-opolis itself, while not comparable with the present
great city, was at that time the fairest city on the face of
the earth. I say this not because it could or did boast of
massive structures, splendid palaces or costly monuments,
for these were absent, but because there was not a mean or
dilapidated building in it and there was not a pauper among
all its people. Millionaires were not numerous, but there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>were several rich men, all of whom, except Thompson,
whose father had died leaving him a vast estate, and Henderson,
who had always been accounted wealthy, were visitors,
or resided in the city to have the advantage of its
hotel and climate. These latter, be it said in passing,
boarded at the Co-opolitan hotel or rented cottages of the
Association. There were some excellent buildings, among
which were numbered the great store of the Department of
Commerce, which had now grown to vast proportions. The
building was four stories high and occupied nearly an
ordinary city block. The larger part of the goods exposed
for sale were produced in Co-opolis.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the next block to this structure, on the site of the
present Co-opolitan Hall, was one which more modern Co-opolis
has placed there, but which had a seating capacity of
10,000, and was the largest and best equipped in the state.
With the grounds belonging to it the hall occupied an entire
block. The next block contained a very sightly high
school edifice and its grounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the avenues in the city were so laid out that they
consisted each of a park fifty feet wide with a driveway of
equal width on each side and resembled in some respects
the boulevards of Paris. The parks were well-kept lawns,
surrounded by young trees and traversed by gravel walks.
The driveways were all paved with asphalt, as were also the
country roads extending in every direction for one mile
beyond the city proper. All avenues and streets were lined
with young, thrifty trees, planted by the Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>All buildings were required to be at least fifty feet apart,
and the spaces between were arranged according to the
taste of the occupants of the houses. There were no fences
in the city. Commonwealth Avenue contained the several
department offices and storage buildings. There were three
electric railroads, which were owned in common by all the
cities, co-operative towns and communities of the state
which at this time centered in Co-opolis. The longest was
one hundred and fifty miles and extended to Boise, the
Capital of the state.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The transcontinental roads also entered the city. But the
application of electricity to nearly all locomotion had enabled
the city to preserve its streets from being marred and
rendered unsightly and dangerous by street railroads. The
electric motorcycles, bicycles and tricycles, operated by
storage batteries, which plied rapidly along the smooth and
clean asphalt streets, were the pleasing harbingers of that
system by which we are now enabled to travel on similar
roads throughout the length and breadth of fair and favored
Idaho.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scene presented by the streets of Co-opolis, on this
convention day, was inspiring. Everywhere the American
flag was displayed, and sentiments of patriotism filled the
air. It was a gala day. Not only had the delegates to the
convention congregated in the city, but friends and enemies
seemed to have thought the event an extremely important
one and came from all parts of the state, as well as
from Western Oregon. At nine o’clock in the morning
groups of people—men and women—wandered through the
streets, viewing the city, and all the public vehicles, motorcycles,
bicycles, tricycles and carriages, were employed in
the same service. For the accommodation and refreshment
of visitors the Commerce department had caused little refreshment
fountains to be stationed in different parts of the
city, along the avenues, and in the parks, containing cool
and pleasant drinks, and lunch counters, in charge of members
of that department, were also located in places. These
supplied the public needs at nominal prices. There were
also pavilions in the parks every six blocks where tired
wanderers could rest themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the chief of the Messenger and Publishing departments
I had charge of the telephones, telegraphs and public
press of the Association. The Daily Co-opolitan was the
only newspaper which this department published at that
time, but the department was required by our law to publish
whatever any member or association of members was
willing to pay for at reasonable rates. The Co-opolitan,
however, had no mission but the publication of news, public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>opinions as represented by articles appearing in other
papers, and such articles as might be contributed, if the
contributors signed them. Anonymous editorials or articles
were prohibited and nothing appeared while the paper
was under my charge except what my judgment or that of
my staff approved. My position was one of great importance,
because I was practically in control of public opinion.
I hope I did not abuse my power and at this time am not
conscious that I did so. The opportunity for such abuse
has since been removed by the establishment of many other
papers all printed and distributed by the Association, but
controlled and edited by persons who advocate their own
views.</p>

<p class='c008'>Seated in the general office of my department that morning
running over the columns of the Co-opolitan, I noticed
an editorial copied from the Boston Transcript of recent
date entitled “A Menace to Liberty.” I immediately read
it and found that it was a direct attack on the Co-opolitan
Association. It classed the movement with the Mormon
occupation of Utah; declared that it was hostile to a republican
form of government; asserted that the men who had
become most prominent in pushing it to the front were
designing and ambitious persons who sought only their own
aggrandizement and alleged that it had become so powerful
in Idaho as to threaten to take control of the state and set
up a government which the constitution of the nation forbade.
It was particularly severe on John Thompson.
“This man,” it said, “is reported to be an illiterate but able
man, possessed of great executive force, who has conceived
the entire plan and has superintended with remarkable
diligence and ability the details of its development. As
President of the company he is the practical uncrowned
king of Idaho. This scheme to embrace a state within the
dominion of one company is the most daring and dangerous
yet attempted by corporate greed. Should it succeed,
grave constitutional questions will arise and congress
will be called upon to deal with this new menace to
liberty and good morals as it did with the Mormon question.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“There is this difference, however, that the monopolistic
octopus now threatening Idaho is entrenched behind an
unfortunate system which recognizes the independence of
states and the obnoxious doctrine of state rights, while the
Mormons, being in a territory which was directly within
the jurisdiction of congress, were struck down by the sentiment
of the entire Union made effective by national legislation.
But as our people found means to rend the veil of
this obnoxious doctrine, to strike down slavery in the
South, so it will find a way to rend it again and strike down
such institutions as this so-called Co-operative Commonwealth
or Co-opolitan Association.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I threw the paper down upon the floor with an expression
and feeling of indignation. I knew that our movement
had attracted wide attention, but never before had I seen
any indication of hostility. The newspaper press of the
United States had generally treated the undertaking as an
experiment which would teach a useful lesson if successful,
but waved it aside as purely idealistic and not likely to
succeed. Now one of the most conservative and reputable
metropolitan dailies in the country, ignoring all its former
expressions of approval, had deliberately reversed itself,
suppressed facts, falsified the truth, and, on the eve of the
success of the co-operative programme in Idaho, had begun
a campaign for its destruction. So entirely consumed was
I, for the moment, by my own passion that I did not notice
the entrance of President Thompson and was somewhat
startled when he saluted me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Brother Braden,” said he, “you seem to be disturbed
about something.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” I replied. “Look at that article from the Boston
Transcript and see whether I, and we, have not cause to
be troubled.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have seen it,” calmly rejoined he. “But,” he continued,
“I am not surprised. Having read extensively and
seen much I have learned that men are quite likely to view
with complacency, and sometimes approval, the development
of an idea, but the moment that idea becomes formidable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>they attack it. I expect, in fact, that we will win
the coming election in this state, but when we call our constitutional
convention I am by no means certain that we
will get the majority of delegates.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed,” said I, “I have never heard you talk so doubtfully
before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know it, Braden,” replied Thompson. “The occasion
has never before arisen. You will find, however, that the
battle for the Co-operative Commonwealth has just begun.
I have come over to see you now about the convention.
Our friends are asking me to be the candidate for governor.
I have not been inclined to accept, but I would be glad if
you will give me your opinion as to whether I ought to
do so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must do so,” I exclaimed. “I have not expected
anything else. I know that you consider your position as
President of the Co-operative Commonwealth an objection
to your assuming other duties. It is not. You should retain
both positions. Why, sir, I expect that when the new constitution
is framed it will provide for a President whose term
of office will be commensurate with the term of our President
and that the officers of one will be the officers of the
other. I expect that this dual character will continue to
exist until every trace of property individualism has disappeared
and that then, instead of the Co-operative Commonwealth
being Idaho, Idaho will be the Co-operative
Commonwealth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was evident that the view so expressed made an impression
on Thompson. We talked it over for nearly an
hour and when the time arrived for the convention to meet
it was practically decided that, if the convention should so
desire, Thompson would accept the nomination for governor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIRST CO-OPERATIVE CONVENTION—THOMPSON NOMINATED FOR GOVERNOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The great hall was thronged with delegates and spectators.
There was a feeling that this convention was to select
the next governor and state officers and people who were
not members, but resided in Idaho, were many of them disposed
to be favorable. The railroads, owners of gold mines,
some of the great cattle kings, real estate brokers, money
loaners and saloons were against us, but the masses were
friendly. We calculated that we had ten thousand more
votes at our disposal than our opponents. It was estimated
by the leaders of the People’s party that more than half of
the inhabitants of the state outside of the Association
would support the ticket, but Thompson had several times
assured me that while more than half were disposed to support
us, most of them had not the mental strength to do so.
Be that as it may the convention met, organized and went
to work. No need to describe all that was done. Mr.
Edmunds, chief of our Department of Education, made a
speech nominating John Thompson for governor. He described
the Co-opolitan Association, presented an historical
sketch of its foundation and development, pictured Co-opolis
as it was when our company reached Hacket’s ranch,
told the story of each year’s work, and, in closing, showed
how one master mind conceived and one master spirit directed
every detail of that magnificent undertaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You would hardly credit, if you were acquainted with
the facts, the history of Co-opolis as I have presented it,”
said he as he proceeded. “From the smallest beginnings
we have progressed to that magnificent estate which lies
before you. The world may behold if it will, and accept the
model if it choose. In five years all this has been effected.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>In the first year we had only the bare land, the running
water, a few cattle and sheep. In the second year we had
five thousand cultivated acres, ten thousand sheep, one
thousand cattle and abundant harvests. In the third year
we had a surplus of produce and wool, forty thousand
sheep, twenty thousand cattle and with the help of irrigation
abundant harvest. In the fourth year, in addition to
two hundred thousand sheep, seventy-five thousand cattle
and abundant harvests, we have added a woolen mill, in
which we manufacture our own woolen blankets and yarn
and knit our own woolen stockings and shirts. We can sell
these in any market. We are now building another mill
and will work our wool product into cloth. You ask how
we have progressed so rapidly? I reply that the Brotherhood
throughout the United States has contributed much
to our enterprise by purchasing our surplus products and
disposing of them in eastern markets. But better than this
we have never lost the labor power of one able-bodied man
during all this time. The confidence of the Brotherhood
in us was due to the magnificent generalship of one great
man, and that one great man was and is John Thompson of
Co-opolis. (Here the enthusiasm became unbounded and
the audience cheered for several minutes.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, my friends, let me say to you that John Thompson
has not only been a general. He inherited a large fortune
from his father and while he has not contributed one cent
of this to the Commonwealth he has sent men at his expense
to several of the great cities of this country to search
out deserving persons and has advanced to them the funds
to come hither and to pay the one hundred dollars required
of each person on admission. These amounts have been
repaid from the wages of the recipient in due time. I say
to you, gentlemen, that this world does not contain a more
thoughtful, able and public-spirited man than John
Thompson, whom I now nominate for governor of Idaho.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Edmunds sat down and the great hall fairly shook
with the applause which, as often as it subsided, was repeated
again and again. James Rutherford of Boise City,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>a delegate who, although a member of the National Brotherhood,
was, as yet, not connected with any colony, seconded
the nomination and moved that President Thompson
be declared the nominee by acclamation. The motion
was put and carried without a dissenting vote amid the
wildest enthusiasm. The nominee having been escorted to
the platform by a committee designated for that purpose,
addressed the convention, after the tremendous cheers
given in his honor had subsided.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he stood facing the great audience waiting an opportunity
to begin I thought I had never seen him look so
masterful before. His tall, powerfully built frame presented
the picture of an athlete, and his face expressed an
intelligence which could only belong to a man of great
intellectual force. He was the personification of strength
of physique, mind and will. His face, as usual, was clean
shaven, his black hair was combed straight back from his
forehead, his large dark eyes surveyed his audience with a
look which was a strange commingling of love and command.
I do not believe a man, friend or enemy, in the multitude
before him doubted his sincerity, or was conscious, for the
moment, of any other sentiment than that of admiration.
He drew all men toward him and, as many have often related
to me since, when they came within his influence
they seemed most naturally to fall in line behind him and
acknowledge him as leader. He began to speak slowly, but
his voice could be heard distinctly throughout the great
hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. President and gentlemen,” said he, “we have now
reached a point in the history of this Commonwealth which
marks the beginning of an epoch. To my mind it is apparent
that all the events of Christian civilization have been
a preparation for the higher civilization which we are privileged
to usher in. It has been said that ‘Time’s noblest
offspring is her last,’ and we may hope that such offspring is
this day born, and that it will thrive and continue to grow
until time shall be no more. I have always believed that
the old system from which we have sought to escape is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>barbaric feudalism, and that, whether in its ancient military
or its modern commercial form, it was distorted by
selfishness and greed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The motives of the robber baron of the dark ages and
the self-serving organizer of trusts to-day do not differ,
and if in the dark ages the one, by force of arms, held
possession of fertile valleys and exacted tribute from neighboring
peoples, the other by fraud monopolizes an industry
and seeks to crush out all competitors. Death strewed the
paths of both, the one being no less hideous in blood than
the other was in the gaunt and shrunken spectre of starvation.
The one, however, spent itself in its own terrors and
disappeared before the awful ravages of destructive war.
So the other has exhausted itself in greed and making the
automaton serve in the stead of man has taught man the
lesson of co-operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have never been a friend to political socialism as a
factor in building up the Co-operative Commonwealth.
My judgment has proposed to me the development of the
co-operative principle in commercial and industrial lines
until it became so strong that it could not be ignored. In
that manner the railroads, telegraphs and other vast interests
from unknown forces, developed into those mighty
giants which came to control the government and now
terrorize the people. I have hoped that the Co-operative
Commonwealth developing in like manner, slowly but
surely, might with very different motives and for different
purposes, become strong enough to take the government
and wield it for the common good of all. If I mistake not,
the time has come, the Commonwealth is equal to its purpose,
and we may assume our political rights. If we win
in the election now approaching the state of Idaho will
become a co-operative state. Our aim should be to establish
our system without encroaching upon the constitution
of the nation. We will violate none of the provisions of
that instrument, but we will carefully observe all its limitations.
This will be no more difficult for us than it is for
the great trusts and monopolies, which have become so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>powerful that they are able to obtain an interpretation of
the constitution when they wish it, whereby its limits have
been and are constantly extended to suit their purposes.
By presenting a model of one co-operative commonwealth,
we may, and I believe will, sooner or later induce other
states to follow our lead, and the entire sisterhood of states
may form one great co-operative nation. But we should
advance to the accomplishment of our purpose, in this state,
with wisdom and caution.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must make as few mistakes as possible. Our endeavor
must be to understand and strictly conform to the
law. We must respect the opinions of those who do not
agree with us. We must not disturb any citizen in the enjoyment
of his property and it should never be forgotten
that the Commonwealth depends for its growth solely upon
volunteers. You have, my friends, nominated me to be the
first governor of Co-operative Idaho. I have consented to
accept this dignity only because I now believe that he who
acts as President of the Co-operative Commonwealth should
also be the governor of the state, until every vestige of the
old system is removed from Idaho and all its people have
voluntarily entered the new system. We must have a dual
government, but the Co-operative Commonwealth must
control it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Idaho, the name of our state, is said to mean ‘Light on
the Mountains.’ We will strive to give it a still broader
signification and, God willing, it shall be a light to all the
people.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Co-operative Commonwealth was conceived by men
who believed the human race capable of advancing to the
highest ideal of civilization. It never depended, for its
success, upon those philosophers who chose to believe that
because they themselves did not feel the pinch of want
therefore none others need feel it, nor of those philanthropists
who were always going about giving that sort of temporary
relief which only served to make the source of poverty
all the more prolific and the cause all the more obscure.
They did not ask advice of learned students of history,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>who by that dim light discovered only the passions
and sins of great sinners, and being diverted by the monsters
whose careers filled the world with their unhallowed
fame, failed to observe the patient, law-abiding, industrious
and sober millions who toiled unobserved in the background.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Co-operative Commonwealth is founded upon the
theory that all men can as well habituate themselves to conform
to higher as to lower standards. The individualist,
the theoretical democrat, urges that our system will tend
to destroy self-reliance and to weaken the individual man.
The same proposition carried to its logical conclusion
would abolish all co-operative effort, and as society, even in
its lowest forms, rests upon co-operation, all society is, if
judged by that standard, but weakening in its effects. But
whether co-operation makes men weak depends upon its
purpose. If it is organized for theft, murder or lewdness,
then it certainly tends to make men morally weak. If it is
organized for luxury, riot or intemperance, then it tends to
make them physically weak. If its purpose is blasphemy,
gross materialism and the prevention of the free investigation
of religious truth, it cannot fail to make men spiritually
weak. The Co-operative Commonwealth is organized
for none of these. Its aim is to produce a better and stronger
man mentally, physically, morally and spiritually. It
gives the fullest education to all and endeavors to make the
minds of its pupils independent and self-reliant. It offers
the largest opportunity for physical culture, and in all
moral and spiritual spheres presents the highest and best
standards, without limiting freedom of thought or criticism.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In brief, the consummation of our programme is, the
complete elimination of speculation, gambling and unjust
advantage from the social state, and to guarantee our members
the rewards of their own efforts. We do not permit the
rich to rob the poor, the strong to prey upon the weak, nor
the keen to sharpen their faculties at the material expense
of those who may be dull. To say that this is injurious to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the development of what is best in man, is to assert that life
has no purpose except physical gain, and that the main
purpose of life is to provide clothing, shelter and food. We
hold that these are only the means of life and that the purpose
of life is the highest development of manhood and
womanhood for the acquisition and appreciation of truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Co-operative Commonwealth is a great insurance
association, and as such guarantees to its member the enjoyment
of his or her earnings. It goes one step further,
and assures him that if accident or sickness shall deprive
him of physical or mental ability, or death shall remove
him from a dependent family, all physical and mental
needs shall be provided for him or them. All such advantages
were and are regarded as lending strength to any
form of society and surely they cannot be other than meritorious
features of our system.</p>

<p class='c008'>“With a firm belief in the righteousness of our great
cause, and assuring you that my life is devoted to your service,
I again express my willingness to accept this nomination.
I need give you but one pledge and giving that you
can feel perfectly secure that your will is to govern the
future. It is my purpose to use my utmost endeavors to
have a constitutional convention called as speedily as possible,
if I shall be elected, and through that convention you,
my brothers, will establish the Co-operative Commonwealth
forever.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the convention went wild with enthusiasm and
the delegates and visitors crowded around the nominee.
I have attended many state conventions, but never before
saw one which resembled so closely in its magnitude and
tumultuous enthusiasm those assemblages in which the national
parties are wont to designate their choice for chief
magistrate of the great republic. The reason, however, was
apparent. All understood that this convention was to initiate
a peaceful revolution whose influence would ultimately
be world-wide in extent.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the enthusiasm attending the nomination had subsided
the convention nominated the remainder of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>ticket. All the candidates were co-operators, but selected
from different localities.</p>

<p class='c008'>For Secretary of State, Addison Wellman of Boise City;
State Treasurer, Benjamin D. Corwin of Alpha, then a
flourishing colony, now a great city, on the Snake river,
about sixty miles from Co-opolis. For Lieutenant-Governor,
Edward J. Murphy of Banford, in the northern part of the
state. This ticket, be it said, did not fully conform to our
plan to have the officers of the state and the association
identical, but it was considered best to unite all our colonies
under one brotherhood government within the state and
then to carry our plan of official identity of state and
brotherhood into effect. The platform adopted was very
brief. It pledged the Co-operative Commonwealth to respect
all vested rights and to conform to the constitution of
the United States, but asserted that the sources and machinery
of material production should be owned in common.
It also declared for a constitutional convention to be
called at an early date.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>MY HOME LIFE—AUNT LYDIA—MISS WOODBERRY—TRIP TO CANYON LAKE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>According to the laws of the Brotherhood each company
was entitled to a fortnightly holiday and as far as possible
work was entirely suspended on Sunday. The day after
the convention was Thursday and the company of which I
was a member enjoyed a “lay-off” on that day. Although
the convention had kept me up late the night before I arose
early, having arranged an outing in the country with a
small company of friends. The Co-opolitan lay on the walk
as I stepped out to sit upon the veranda while breakfast was
being prepared. I picked it up and sitting down proceeded
to read the news. At that time my residence was on Salem
Avenue where it widened into an extensive park in which
was a lake fed from an artesian well around which a grove
of young trees grew luxuriantly. My house was not a large
one. It had been constructed for me by the association, as
all private dwellings had been for their occupants, upon a
plan such as the occupant furnished. The estimated cost
to the Association was one thousand dollars as represented
by orders paid out by it for the labor and material used. It
is well to state here that the construction of a house was to
the Association hardly more than a question of labor. My
house was, like all the dwellings in the city at that time
except apartment houses, a frame structure. The timber
had been obtained from the neighboring forests by our own
people without cost. It had been sawed into lumber by our
mills. It had been put together by our carpenters.
The stone for the foundations, the lime for the walls and
ceiling, the brick, mortar, sand, and, in short, all but the
nails, screws, locks and gears were produced by the labor of
our own people. Three years later, even these were manufactured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>in Idaho. So that the house cost little more than
the cost of the labor employed in its construction. But it
was, nevertheless, as well built and as commodious as one
costing three thousand dollars in an eastern city under the
competitive system, showing that our co-operative system
was at least three times as effective in this line as the
competitive system. This showing, however, is limited to
the building trades alone, and does not include the enormous
increase of productivity by the employment of all
labor power in the direction of greatest utility.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rooms were all provided with open fireplaces for
heating purposes, but the cooking apparatus consisted of a
gas stove. Gas, electricity, steam heating and both hot and
cold water were furnished by the Association at a small
cost. In fact the rent of the house, its lighting and heating
as well as its supply of water, cost me only one hundred and
forty-four dollars per year, or twelve dollars per month, and
the service was complete. Besides this, any repairs needed
were attended to at once and the house was kept in perfect
order. The furniture was also provided by the department
store as selected by myself. Even the carpets were manufactured
in Co-opolis. This furniture was paid for by me
in Commonwealth orders and was mine without reservation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In those times most of us preferred to prepare our breakfasts
at home, but we usually either had our other meals
sent from the public kitchens close at hand or went to the
public dining halls or hotel. The Domestic department had
charge of the entire domestic work of the city and companies
were stationed in each precinct for that purpose.
Whenever any house wanted domestic work performed it
was only necessary to telephone to the proper station and a
well-trained domestic, either man or woman, as desired, was
sent for the purpose. The time of the domestic was
charged to the house and the cost of the service collected
by the department each month, like the rent, gas, telephone,
water and heating bills. The streets and grounds
were kept in order by the city at the public expense.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>For nearly a year an aunt of mine, an old widow of most
excellent character, had been keeping house for me. She
was not a member of the association, did no service and
drew no pay, but lived entirely on my bounty. She was a
strict Congregationalist of the New England type, read
her bible diligently, assisted in maintaining a religious society
of that denomination, and was one of the most kindly
and lovable souls in our neighborhood. She was, of course,
too old to become an active member of the society and too
poor to purchase a membership. She did not altogether
approve the system in operation in Co-opolis, but rarely
ever expressed any criticism upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>I think she was as comfortable and happy as any old lady
in the country, for her time was employed, either in sewing,
light domestic work, reading, writing letters home, or riding
with the motorcycle which I kept at her disposal. She
was always endeavoring to economize in household matters
because she felt that she was a charge upon me. It was in
vain that I assured her of the growing wealth of Co-opolis,
and tried to get her to realize that I had a share in all this
wealth which would last me my lifetime. She could not
comprehend it and still continued to save.</p>

<p class='c008'>This morning she was quite busy, according to her usual
custom, and it was not long after I sat down to read that
her cheerful voice called me to partake of the morning
meal. It was not an elaborate one, but it was an Idaho production
almost entirely. The rolled oats were grown,
rolled and prepared in Co-opolis; the flour, maple syrup,
butter and even the sugar were made in Idaho, and none
better were ever made elsewhere. The sugar was the
product of the beet-sugar factory at Laselle, which had
been established by the National Brotherhood two years
before. The salt was manufactured by our Association, and
this morning we had plates which were among the first
productions of a new industry added by the Department of
Manufactures just two months previously. The silver on
the table was some which I had inherited from my mother
and was highly prized. The oak extension table, sideboard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>and chairs in the dining room also represented our Co-opolitan
labor. Aunt Lydia sat at the table with me and
served the coffee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Willie,” said she, as she reached me the cream, “I guess
I won’t go to-day. I promised Mrs. Cressy that I would
spend a day with her, and she has a holiday; so, if you have
no objection, I will go there instead of the lake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Aunt Lydia,” I exclaimed, “what has made you
change so suddenly? Of course you must go with us. Mr.
Fuller and Joe Preston are all going and if you don’t go I’ll
simply have to ride alone. You must go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Willie.” She always called me Willie. “No,” she
declared again. “The Prestons have company just from
Boston, a Miss Woodberry; I met her yesterday. She seems
to be a very nice young lady and I want you to go with her
and show her the valley.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, aunt,” I replied, “I will do nothing of the kind.
I want you to go and have made my arrangements accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But my aunt was obdurate and all I could say was unavailing.
The truth was she was anxious that I should
marry and was, very much to my annoyance at times, always
contriving to throw me in the way of young ladies,
hoping that I would meet my fate. I suspected that this
was another scheme of that kind and felt provoked. If I
could have found a good excuse I would have canceled my
engagement and remained at home. But no excuse presented
itself. What was even worse, as I thought, my aunt
had gone so far as to invite Miss Woodberry to take her
place in the party, which that young lady as a guest of the
Prestons, who were also going, very naturally and promptly
accepted. Of course I could not scold the dear old meddling
lady, and so, although much put out, I philosophically
submitted to the inevitable.</p>

<p class='c008'>After breakfast Joe Preston, a young man about twenty,
who had just entered the Industrial Army, in the Transportation
department, but who had a holiday also, came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>over and said that he had been to the precinct kitchen and
had all the edibles put up for the trip and that Miss Woodberry
was ready to go whenever I was. He took the motorcycle
from the shed back of the house, adjusted the storage
battery, and conducted the vehicle around to the front
door. I entered and a minute later we were at the door of
the Preston cottage, where we found the entire party, Miss
Woodberry among the rest, waiting with their vehicles.
The formalities of an introduction over I assisted Miss
Woodberry to her place and seating myself by her side we
started away, the rest of the party following.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our destination was the lake made by damming the
waters of Deer River and flowing about two hundred acres
of land in the canyon where the stream emerges from the
mountains. We called it Canyon Lake and laid out a
park around it, which at that time was not completed, but
gave promise of much beauty. It was my intention to
ascend the divide south of the city, pursue the road which
ran along the slope and take in the scenery which delighted
the eye from that elevation. So we followed the asphalt
pavement as far as it went in that direction and then rolled
along the smoothly macadamized country driveway. The
Co-opolitans of that day were very proud of their roads and
spent much time and labor upon them. They were all
wide, smooth and well shaded and accommodations for
drinking both for man and beast—horses were still in use
for drawing heavy burdens at that time—were provided
from the big flume and the reservoirs of our system of irrigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lady by my side was enthusiastic over all she saw
and so bright and unaffected were her remarks and exclamations
that, before we had gone very far, I began to
enjoy her society. She was not a remarkably handsome
person, but she had what I suppose my female acquaintances
would call “style.” That, of course, was a matter of
dress, all of which had its effect on me as fashion intended,
but none of which I could describe. In a general way I
could see that she had a jaunty hat full of bright-colored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>artificial flowers, a loose-fitting white waist and a gown of
some blue material. Her form was tall and rather slender,
her hair auburn, her features somewhat pronounced, but
intellectual, her mouth indicated firmness, but was in an
everlasting conspiracy with a pair of large blue eyes to express
all that is bright and sunny in the feminine character.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had one of those faces, in which no feature was above
criticism, but upon which so many happy thoughts and
kindly emotions were continually expressing themselves,
that criticism was as soon forgotten as made, and once forgotten
was never recalled. I was seized, as we walked together,
with a great desire to show her novel or beautiful
scenes, and to tell her what I knew. I never enjoyed anything
so much as the varying expressions of her face, always
intelligent, always pure, always gentle, and withal
full of strong character. It was evident that she had read
much, seen many places and had a clear understanding.
But it was also apparent that she was in search of the pure,
the beautiful, the good, and she was altogether like what
she sought. One most remarkable fact about her was that
although a Bostonian she did not insist that Boston should
be the sole subject of conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>After an hour’s journey from the city, moving rapidly
along the levels, swiftly down the inclines and slowly up
the steep road which ascended to the divide, we reached the
place which I have always considered the best from which
to view Co-opolis. Here our party halted for a time, remaining
in our carriages and discussing the many objects
of interest. The mountains, black and threatening, looked
down upon us as if with sullen displeasure, and beyond the
wild wastes of treeless and houseless valleys, far to the
south, rose the weird forms of the Seven Devils, presiding
over a kind of a golden Hades. But it was not the mountains
nor the wilderness which attracted us mostly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before us lay the garden of brotherly love, in whose
bosom nestled the fair city of Co-opolis. That city was
indeed a picture of peace and loveliness, with all its great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>public buildings, its wide streets, its artificial lakes and
magnificent urban parks. I pointed out the buildings and
parks to my lady companion and took much pleasure in
giving her brief historical sketches of several of them. But
even Co-opolis, with all its artificial beauty, was not the
greatest object of interest. The valley itself, subjected to
the most thorough cultivation to which the most approved
methods could reduce it, lay before us “as fair as the garden
of the gods upon the slopes of Eden.” Directing our attention
to the north we saw the silvery expanse of Canyon
Lake glistening in the sun. Along both the northern and
southern slopes of the valley extended the finely constructed
ditches and flumes conducting the waters of the lake to
many different reservoirs, where they were stored and distributed
when occasion demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>I explained, what was a fact, that the rainfall in this
region had increased to such an extent since the valley became
inhabited and cultivated that for two years the supply
of water had been comparatively little used in irrigation.
But irrigation assured us our crops and there was no
danger that a drought would ever destroy them. Eighty
thousand acres constituted our cultivated farm. I pointed
out the apple, peach and pear orchards and vineyards and
spoke of the promise these orchards and vineyards gave of
a large supply of fruit in perhaps another year. I showed
the corn, wheat and potato fields, the vegetable gardens and
the extensive hothouses, and explained that at times three
thousand members of our Industrial Army were engaged
on the farm.</p>

<p class='c008'>We could also see the numerous sheds constructed in
sheltered places, for the sheep and cattle which our shepherds
and herders attended on the ranges, and the large
barns here and there in which the harvests were stored and
kept. The fields and ranges had produced in the last two
years an enormous surplus. This surplus, however, the
Brotherhood in the nation had taken or it had been distributed
at the instance of the Brotherhood among the new
colonies which it had established throughout the state.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>My companion asked me the wealth of the colony, and
my answer was that its buildings could not be constructed
in any competitive eastern city for less than $15,000,000.00,
but that they probably cost an amount of labor estimated
by our standards at $4,500,000.00. The 80,000 acres of
land, to which the Association had title, were worth $50.00
per acre at least, or $4,000,000.00. The personal property,
consisting of machinery, stocks of goods, sheep, cattle,
horses, wagons, tricycles, bicycles, motorcycles and farm
products, were worth $8,500,000.00 and the water right,
irrigating ditches, electric railroads, gas and electric plants,
water system for the city, heating system and public utilities
which brought or could be made to bring a revenue,
were produced by the labor of the Industrial Army, without
an outlay of much cash, and were worth at least $5,500,000.00.
All this has been created by labor in five years,
and, of course, the value of the city lots is not estimated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet the mere fact that 15,000 people lived on these lots
was sufficient to give them an enormous value if they were
to be sold for cash. Indeed, I think the lots in the city at
that time wore worth $4,000,000.00 as an investment, based
upon their rental values.</p>

<p class='c008'>We continued our observation of the valley in this manner
for about half an hour and then rather reluctantly
moved on. The day was spent pleasantly, in fishing, sailing
and picnicking. There was at the lake an Association
restaurant where, in the summer time, fish dinners were
made a specialty. Special attention was given to supplying
our city with fresh fish and a large fish hatchery was also
located here. The event of the day, however, was the observation
of the scenery from the divide both on the trip to
and the trip from the lake, for we again stopped on our
return and again feasted upon that vision of fertility and
abundance.</p>

<p class='c008'>When we arrived home that evening we were still intent
on the full enjoyment of our holiday, and, as the great
French tragedienne, with a superb company, had been engaged
for the week by the Association, we went to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>theater. Here, again, Aunt Lydia, having an aversion for
theatrical performances, which New England Congregationalism
had instilled into her, preferred to remain at
home, and I was once more obliged to accompany my newfound
friend Miss Woodberry. I may say, however, that
whatever my aunt’s aversion to the theater may have been
I did not share it and the aversion which I felt in the morning
to leaving my good, old aunt at home was not so keenly
felt in the evening.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>THE CAMPAIGN OF 1902—DRIVING CAPITAL FROM THE STATE—THE POLITICAL MINISTER—VICTORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The political campaign of 1902 in Idaho was one of the
most notable ever waged in the United States. It was interesting
to the entire country because it was understood
that if the Co-operative Commonwealth was victorious the
changes which would be effected in the government, laws
and industrial system of the state would be radical and
sweeping. The moneyed interests all over the country were
alarmed, but it may be said that in those times the “moneyed
interests” were always in a state of alarm at every
suggestion of a reform which proposed the betterment of
the condition of the masses.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a result of this “alarm” a system of colonization in
Idaho was begun with a view to outvoting the co-operators
on election day. But the extent of the Brotherhood of the
Co-operative Commonwealth was little understood by the
business and moneyed interests of the nation. They supposed
it to be practically confined to Idaho when in truth it
had its branches throughout the entire country. The effort
to colonize voters in Idaho was rendered abortive except in
the mining regions of the northern part of the state, and
even there the colonizers were not as successful as they supposed.
The Brotherhood, secretly giving the most useful
aid to co-operators, caused many ardent friends to be enlisted
as colonists of the enemy, and these, immediately on
arrival in Idaho, communicated with our leaders and we
were kept constantly informed as to the movements of the
opposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Brotherhood numbered one million members outside
of Idaho and if we had asked them to contribute to our
financial strength they could and would have sent us from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>one to five million dollars. This, however, was deemed
unnecessary, and we confined our expenditures to the education
of the masses with regard to our purposes, and the
prevention of the gross frauds which we expected the opposition
to perpetrate. Great speakers of national fame were
sent from all parts of the country to discuss the issues of
this campaign. Competition and co-operation had here
locked horns and this tremendous issue was to be fought
out once for all.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal argument made by the opposition was that
the success of co-operation, besides destroying personal liberty,
would drive out all the capital in the state, and all the
capital approaching the state away from it. To this position,
which was depicted on every opposition stump, our
great leader, President Thompson, always made but one
reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Drive capital from the state!” exclaimed he. “Prevent
its entrance! Why! Let them take every dollar of gold
and silver and every item of what they call credit away forever.
Let them leave us the land and ability to labor and
we will speedily reverse the order. Instead of Idaho being
a suppliant at the door of capital, we shall soon see capital,
so boastful and arrogant now, an abject suppliant at the
door of Idaho.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Instead of capital directing industry we shall find industry
directing and controlling capital. But how will they
withdraw capital? Will they fill up the mines they
have dug? Will they tear up the rails they have laid? Will
they stop their trains on the boundary line or rush through
without stopping? Will they transport the houses and
farms on which they hold mortgages? They can, of course,
do none of these things, nor do they contemplate it. But
they say we intend to repudiate our indebtedness to them.
In the great record of the Omniscient Lawgiver, in which
the list of those moral obligations which ought to be kept
are found, it is not probable that all the debts of the people
are numbered, but into that we shall never inquire. All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>moral and legal obligations which rest upon it shall be
strictly and fully paid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fight waxed warmer as election day approached.
Every effort was made to stir up the basest passions against
the Co-operative Commonwealth. We heard of a riot and
what amounted almost to a pitched battle in the mining
regions of the Coeur d’Alene Mountains, and learned, to
our surprise, that we had a large number of adherents
among the Trade Unionists and the Miners’ Unions of that
section. An equally great surprise was that, although our
movement was in no sense hostile to any church, and as a
matter of fact encouraged all religious denominations in
their work, the ministers of the gospel were, as a rule,
among our most bitter opponents and, excepting those who
presided over co-operators of their own denominations,
they were disposed to denounce us as opposed to morals.
I regret to say that from this class of campaign speakers
and political workers came the most outrageous misrepresentations
of the campaign.</p>

<p class='c008'>I beg to be understood aright. I make no charge against
the church, or against ministers. God knows that I have
the highest regard for both, but I have noticed not only in
connection with the campaign of 1902 but other great campaigns
before and since that when they step out of their
true sphere into politics these amiable, innocent and estimable
gentlemen generally become the catspaws of the
most unscrupulous political monkeys. They are undeniably
caught by men who make the loudest professions of
honesty, justice and virtue, when in truth those who proclaim
their merits in these regards with the greatest vigor
are not necessarily the most sincere or deserving. Vigor of
tongue does not always indicate a healthy conscience, but
it generally catches the political minister.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day before election Thompson and I met at the Co-opolitan.
The work of the campaign was now practically
completed as far as speaking was concerned. Thompson
had certainly done his duty, for he had spoken in every
county seat and every considerable town in the state.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Everywhere he had been welcomed by great crowds and
everywhere it had been acknowledged that he was a man
of commanding genius. Indeed, all this was conceded by
the newspaper press throughout the Union. But he told
me confidentially that he did not trust the appearances
which seemed so flattering and cited several instances to
show the uncertainty of political events. I was a younger
man and my enthusiasm caused me to entertain no doubt
of the complete success of our entire programme.</p>

<p class='c008'>Election day passed off without incident. The vote was
heavy. Every woman of voting age, as well as every man,
voted, and the vote cast was more than twice as large as the
state had ever cast in any previous election, the grand total
being 190,000. Of these our ticket received 115,000, giving
us a majority of 40,000. We had elected more than two-thirds
of both houses of the legislature and the victory for
the Co-operative Commonwealth was complete.</p>

<p class='c008'>How we shouted, and went nearly mad with joy in Co-opolis.
The total vote of our city, numbering 6,661, had
been cast for the entire ticket. I have not mentioned the
fact that in the distribution of political honors I had received
the nomination, equivalent to election, for state senator,
and I may now say that I was unanimously elected.</p>

<p class='c008'>I did not vote for myself.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was the only candidate. When the result of the election
was known we appointed the following evening for a
grand jollification. It was an occasion to be remembered.
The army, 7,000 strong, not all residents of Co-opolis, as
some were permanently stationed in the country, marched
through the streets, with music furnished by the city band.
This band consisted of one hundred first-class musicians,
and was one of the best in the entire western country.
There were other amateur bands which were drilled to a
high degree of excellence, and the army marched to such
music. There was a grand illumination in the evening, and
a magnificent display of fireworks.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE BROTHERHOOD CONVEYS ITS IDAHO POSSESSIONS TO THE CO-OPOLITAN ASSOCIATION—ARRANGEMENTS FOR COLONISTS—TYPICAL INSTANCES—JARVIS RICHARDSON—MRS. ELIZABETH MAXON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The National Brotherhood of the Co-operative Commonwealth
had prior to the election of 1902, in a delegate convention
held in Chicago, passed a resolution approving the
Co-opolitan system of co-operation and directing that all
colonies and colonists entering Idaho, under its auspices,
after January 1st, 1903, enter and become merged in Colony
Number One, as Co-opolis was named in the Brotherhood
records. It also transferred all its property, including
the beet-sugar factory at Laselle, a gold mine at Banford,
in the Coeur d’Alene Mountains, and several large tracts
of land and small colonies to us, upon the theory that we
were better able to superintend the details of state building,
while the Brotherhood should simply aid us with funds to
extend our good works, furnish us with colonists and distribute
our surplus product.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our Legislation Council, anticipating large accessions to
our population on this account, was in constant session and
during the entire winter of 1902–3 large plans were under
consideration for the utilization of the new labor power.
The National Brotherhood had contracted not to send us
more than 10,000 new members during the year 1903 and
to pay us $1,000,000.00 cash or one hundred dollars for
each person sent for our surplus products stored in various
barns and storehouses.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not considered that these new colonists should all
remain in Co-opolis. About two thousand of them were to
be retained in certain productive lines in which we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>already prepared to set them at work. One of these was a
large woolen mill located down the stream toward Snake
River, capable of employing one thousand hands. We had
a large quantity of wool on hand, and were ready to take all
which was offered in exchange for goods at the department
store. It was also agreed between the National Brotherhood
and our council that they should send us one thousand
persons skilled in the manufacture of woolen fabrics.
These we agreed to receive on equal terms with all other
members. We also arranged for the establishment of a
large boot and shoe factory, an extensive fruit and vegetable
canning factory, and another one still for the slaughtering,
dressing, preparing and packing of pork, beef and
other meats. The slaughter houses were designed to be
situated about six miles from Co-opolis over the divide on
the Seven Devils branch of the Oregon Short Line. These
skilled artisans numbered in all about three thousand. The
rest, consisting of six thousand adults, were to enter the
Industrial Army as common workers.</p>

<p class='c008'>We estimated that we could employ this new industrial
army in opening up another large valley in the same
county fifteen miles south of Co-opolis. That valley was in
nearly all respects similar to Deer Valley, except that it was
larger and the divides and tables were covered with a thick
growth of timber. We considered that it was proper to retain
about half of the seven thousand new men to work in
and about Co-opolis and to send an equal number of our
older members to the new fields. The plan was, first of all,
to provide irrigation; second, to break thirty thousand acres
of land and seed it to corn; third, to construct buildings
sufficiently commodious to house the companies of the
Industrial Army which might be necessary to make the
valley productive and protect its structures and products
from destruction. It was then intended to be a sort of an
industrial outpost for Co-opolis, and was placed in charge
of the Agricultural department.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the new colonists began to arrive in large numbers
the scene presented in the main hall of the building was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>interesting. The department chiefs took turns presiding
at the hearing of applications for membership. I remember
very well my own experience one day the latter part of
January. I had obtained a temporary leave of absence
from the senate in order to assume the duties as chief of
my department. There were eight hundred newcomers,
men and women. Each was sworn to answer truly all questions
put touching his or her age, education, trade or calling,
nationality, former place of residence, family and career.
His application, together with certificates of medical
examiners, was examined and if approved by the National
Brotherhood the following contract was handed him for his
signature: “It is hereby agreed by and between Peter
Jones, party of the first part, and Colony Number One of
the Co-operative Commonwealth known as the Co-opolitan
Association, party of the second part, that in consideration
of the promises, agreements and undertakings hereinafter
set forth, said first party enters the employ of said second
party as a laborer for the term of three years. That he
agrees to do and perform any and all work which said second
party shall require of him in any part of the state of
Idaho to the best of his ability. That he agrees to conform
to all the rules, regulations and laws which are now in force
or shall become in force in or in connection with said
colony, provided the same do not impair the obligation
hereof. Said second party agrees to pay said first party
for said service in the products of labor on hand or obtainable
by said second party, an amount equal to forty per cent
of the yearly product of the labor of said colony divided by
the total number of members of said colony above the age
of twenty years, less fines and forfeitures, the same to be
paid in such amounts, and at such times, within each year,
as shall be provided by the Legislative Council of said second
party.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The examination to which applicants were subjected is
well illustrated by the record of one who has since become
one of the famous Industrial chiefs of the state.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is your name, age, occupation and place of residence?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>asked I of a medium-sized man with a strong,
square face, and a large forehead, who arose and held up his
right hand to take the oath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Name, Jarvis Richardson. Age, thirty years. Occupation,
printer. Former residence, St. Paul, Minnesota.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Name of former employer and when last employed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pioneer Press Publishing Company. Was laid off three
years ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reason for discharge?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Improved typesetting machines.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you understand and favor co-operation, or are you
desirous of entering the Brotherhood for temporary protection?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe I understand the principle and purpose of co-operation.
Having been excluded from usefulness in my
own trade by the introduction of labor-saving devices, I
realize that an injustice has been done me. I should have
had the benefit of the labor-saving device, but instead of
that I am simply supplanted by an automaton. The machine
which excluded me from my place and has kept me
comparatively idle ever since does the work which it formerly
took five men to do. If the same results were accomplished,
as it ultimately will be, in all departments four-fifths
of the labor of human beings would be thrown aside
and four-fifths of the laborers would starve. This would
curtail the consumption of products of such machinery, and
a portion of those who operate them would then be discharged
on the plea of hard times, limited demand and
overproduction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The industrial system now in operation throughout the
Christian world was devised for an ignorant and barbarous
people. Invention, learning, industry and progress are
showing its entire inefficiency. Learning must be limited to
a few if that system is to live. Under it, if industry produces
enough for all, stagnation results, because that system
makes no provision for wise and equitable distribution.
Progress is impossible because it strains society to a point
of revolution and destruction follows. The co-operative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>system, on the contrary, deems labor-saving machinery a
blessing, and its adoption simply increases production and
is a relief and benefit to the laborer. It does not diminish
his share of the product, but reduces his hours of labor.
You cannot have too much education and learning in the
co-operative system because all are educated, and yet each
is required to submit to his share of labor and drudging.
This tends to destroy false pride, and prevent vanity.
Moreover, men come to realize their true relation to one
another.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Industry can never cause overproduction in the co-operative
system. If too much is produced for the members
to consume they do not therefore find it necessary to starve
a portion of their number. Such a condition is hurtful to
none. The co-operative system demands progress. Every
step forward brings a reward and does not suggest a danger.
Every advance is a blessing not to a few, but to all. A
system which is large enough, just enough and expansive
enough to admit of the unfoldment of all the powers and
virtues of the race cannot be less than Christian.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The manner of the applicant as he expressed himself was
that of a polished and educated gentleman. It was not customary
for us to encourage lengthy speeches on the part of
applicants, during the year 1903 nor the years following,
but once in a while a man of commanding will and intellect
would challenge our attention and we would listen to him
as I did to Mr. Richardson. He was a sufferer from one
cause, and understood the cause and its only cure far better
than a philosopher who only observes and could not feel
the condition it imposed on him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is claimed that the individual is weakened and made
dependent by our system, Mr. Richardson,” said I. “The
claim is also made that the man who escapes the perils of
the industrial system comes out with a stronger character
and a more independent manhood than if such perils had
not been encountered. Have you a different opinion?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not know,” was the reply, “how great a manhood
your system will develop. It teaches, however, the lesson of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>brotherhood, and gives me protection for my wife and
babies by furnishing me an opportunity to be industrious.
The competitive system might not be objectionable if it
would do the same. But it does not permit fair competition.
It demands that a man be industrious, but gives him
no chance to work. It permits a few to monopolize land,
water, power, money and all the sources, means and machinery
of production, and then asks the disinherited and
landless ones to compete when competition is impossible.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The system called competitive is not competitive. It
is a system whereby a favored few are permitted to rob the
many. As for the perils of that system developing character,
I admit they do. The most remarkable character and
those most admired in it are the modern Shylocks. If that
sort of character is desirable, then the system is a success,
but I do not covet its benefits. It seems to me the perils of
savagery are much more effective to bring out strong traits
of character and build up a manhood more courageous, self-reliant,
and even heroic, certainly not more brutal, than
the trading, cozening, cheating, gambling, sordid methods
which make up this so-called ‘Competitive System.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not possible for me in the press of business to continue
the conversation further that day. Indeed, the arguments
offered by the applicant were not new to me, and it
was only because of the strong individuality of the man that
I stopped to converse with him at all. It was, however, a
part of my business to investigate the qualifications of applicants
and when they had been accepted to enroll them
in the proper department. Each department had its enrolling
clerk present, who received the signature of the new
member in the department to which he was assigned. A
few formal questions more were put to Mr. Richardson and
I assigned him to the Messenger and Publishing department,
where a vacancy had occurred within a week by the
death of a trusted member.</p>

<p class='c008'>He of course entered as a mere printer, being compelled
to earn promotion by the efficiency of his work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The examination and acceptance of applicants went on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>with great rapidity after this, and no incident occurred
worthy of note until after the noon lunch. A woman about
thirty-six years old presented her application. After the
usual formal questions I asked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you married?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am a widow,” she answered; “my husband was killed
in a railroad collision five years ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you children?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have seven—three boys and four girls.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you them with you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All are here. Mr. Thompson advised me to come and
make this application, so I have been saving up all my
money and I am here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say you live in Boise? You are not recommended
by the Brotherhood. Have you any recommendations?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have one from Mr. Thompson.” Here she handed me
a note from our President, now Governor of the state, and
upon reading it I found that she was an intelligent and
deserving woman who was anxious to educate her children.
She had saved, through several years’ hard work at the
washtub and in various kinds of domestic work, the fee
necessary to enter the colony, and, although it was her all,
she was ready to pay it for such a purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What shall I do for a home?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have excellent houses, in one of which you shall
live,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can I send my children to school?” she continued.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are required to do so. Education is compulsory.
Your children will be turned over to the Department of
Education.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Am I to be separated from them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and they will live together in the same house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I am a member of the Episcopal church. I desire
my children brought up in that church.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The religious education of your children is your own
care. Send them to what church you will. Episcopal,
Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, Congregationalist and other
denominations are represented here.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Would it be wrong for me to ask how much my wages
are to be?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will receive checks or orders the first year entitling
you to one-third as much as a skilled first-year member.
The second year you will receive as much as any other member
of the Industrial Army, skilled or unskilled, officer or
private. Last year each member received $1,200.00 in orders
or checks entitling him to the use of public conveyances,
railroads, house, water, gas, light, heat and other
public utility, to goods, wares and merchandise, meals at
restaurant or hotel, to admission to entertainments, use of
public ovens, and, in short, whatever you need. If your
children are infants the Department of Education has
trained nurses to care for them. If a mother is nursing her
babe we give her a furlough until the period of nursing
ceases, but her pay continues. We encourage the mother
to be with her children as much as possible, as we believe a
mother’s love is one of the influences, under proper conditions,
which inspire purity and develop manhood and
womanhood in the child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if I must work I cannot care for my children and
get them ready for school in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Women who have children are placed, as far as possible,
in companies which do their work during what are called
school hours. You will be assigned to the Domestic department
and its officers will place you where you belong.
You will go to your work at 9 o’clock and continue until
12. You will then take an hour for your own lunch and
returning to work continue until 5.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I felt great satisfaction at being able to give this poor
woman information which restored almost immediately the
light of hope to her careworn face. She only asked one
more question. She wanted to know what would become of
her children in case she should die, and when I told her
that children who once entered our Department of Education
were always protected, clothed and supported, without
the slightest dishonor, by the Association and afterward
entered our Industrial Army on equal terms with all others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>she seemed so happy that the bystanders wept and I felt my
own eyes grow moist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several days after this, being anxious to learn the fate of
this woman, whose name was recorded as Elizabeth Maxon,
I entered, inquired at the office of the Domestic department,
where she was enrolled, and learned that she had
been assigned by her department chief to laundry work
and that her place of residence was number 800 Pine Street.
I took occasion to call there. Upon my ringing the electric
bell the door was opened by a bright-faced little girl of
about fifteen summers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is your mother at home?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” was the reply. “Will you come in?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She ushered me through a small carpeted hallway, into a
neatly furnished parlor, the floor of which was also carpeted,
and the furniture in which appeared to be quite new.
Having been politely offered a chair, I sat down, and being
informed that “mamma” would be in directly I waited. A
minute later Mrs. Maxon appeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Maxon,” I said, arising, “you will doubtless look
upon my visit as an intrusion, but I felt so deep an interest
in your welfare, after your application and examination for
membership, that I had to hunt you up. Perhaps you will
remember me as the man who presided at that time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed!” she exclaimed. “Mr. Braden, certainly this is
an honor and not an intrusion. You were so kind to me
on that occasion that I shall never forget you. Will you be
seated, sir?”</p>

<p class='c008'>I sat down again. Mrs. Maxon also seated herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would be glad to learn how you fared,” I resumed.
“Will you permit me to ask you a few questions?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, indeed!” was the quick answer. “I will answer
any question. The people are so good to me here that I feel
that you are all brothers and sisters. And see,” (she waved
her hand around her), “I have never lived in such a pleasant
house before. It is heated by steam which comes from
pipes laid under the streets and we have water, gas and
electricity.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Do you like your work?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is very pleasant. Most of the work at the laundry is
done by machinery and the machinery does five times as
much work as the force we have there could do by hand.
All the hard work is done by machinery. Then I have only
to work seven hours a day, too.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you get so well settled?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The next day after the examination I was told to go to
the office of the Domestic department on Commonwealth
Avenue. I went. The gentleman in charge told me that
when an active member paid a membership fee of $100.00
the company gave a labor check to her in return representing
$100.00 worth of goods. He gave me the amount in
such check and then directed a gentleman to take me and
my children to number 800 Pine Street, where we should
live. He hailed a passing motor car and we got on that and
rode to this house, my children with me. The gentleman
did not pay my fare, but I paid it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was surprised that it only amounted to what would be
two cents of my hundred dollars. I was quite surprised
also to find that we were to have such a nice house. But
there was no furniture in it then. I left my children with
our neighbor, and went up to the department house and
ordered these carpets, furniture and other things. They
let me have them on time, with the understanding that they
were to keep the title until they were paid for. I got a few
groceries from the store and some meat and brought them
home myself. The furniture came about 2 o’clock that
afternoon and before supper time we were almost settled.
A bell rang out there in the dining room and I found a telephone
there. I answered it and found that the foreman of
the company which I was told to enter had some directions.
He said I was to go over to the ward office of the Department
of Education, about two blocks from here, and report
with my children at 9 o’clock next morning and then to
report to him at 9:30 o’clock for duty. So I did, and all my
little ones were taken and sent to school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you then comfortable?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“I am very, very happy. I never dreamed that such good
would come to me after my husband died. But God has
directed me here and I am very, very happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The conversation continued a few minutes longer. All
her little children, with bright and shining faces, came in
to see me, and I was overflowing with sympathetic enthusiasm
myself before I was able to tear myself away.
And I thought to myself as I returned to my home that the
joy our system brought to these comparatively humble people
was the best indication that we were now, in truth, upon
the threshold of a higher civilization; a civilization that
uses all power, both mechanical and human, to lift up all
humanity; a civilization which does not content itself by
simply emblazoning the golden rule upon painted banners
and church walls, but makes it the measure of every public
act toward all men, women and children alike.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>IDAHO ELECTS A SENATOR—PARALYSIS OF THE COMPETITIVE SYSTEM—BLIGHT AFFECTS THE CAPITAL CITY—CAPITAL WITHDRAWS FROM THE STATE—A SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE—CO-OPOLIS ESTABLISHES A DEPARTMENT STORE AND HOTEL AT BOISE CITY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Governor Thompson was inaugurated at Boise City January,
1903. There was no demonstration on the occasion,
the Governor being sworn in by the Chief Justice of the
Supreme court of the state without display. The Legislature
convened the same day, the Lower House elected its
speaker, and the next day the various committees of both
branches of the lawmaking body were appointed. The
third day the entire political machinery of Idaho, with the
exception of some minor officers and some members of the
judiciary, was under the control of the Co-operators.</p>

<p class='c008'>The work to be performed by the Legislature was regarded
as pressing and important. A senator was to be
elected to represent the state in the United States senate.
The complexion of the two houses made it certain that the
new senator would be a Co-operator. As for that matter so
was the then incumbent. He was a member of the People’s
party and also a member of the Brotherhood and of the Co-opolitan
colony. He was a man of wealth and, being past
the age of forty-five, had transferred property to our colony
worth twenty years of a Co-operator’s income, estimated
upon the basis of such income January 1st, 1902. In addition
to this, his assistance as senator from Idaho had been
invaluable to our cause. When a man became a member, in
this manner, the Association, while leaving him his own
property and the income which he derived from it, required
that all wages, salaries and compensation, which his
skill, labor or use of time might earn should be the property
of the Association, so that the senator’s yearly salary belonged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to it. We took but one vote on the senatorial question,
and the sitting senator was by that vote elected to
succeed himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this Legislature had some really serious questions to
consider besides that of electing a senator. It was confronted
by a condition which to all individuals in the state
seemed appalling. The public, outside of the co-operative
colonies in the state, and outside the Brotherhood of the
Co-operative Commonwealth out of the state, was filled
with alarm at the prospect of certain radical reforms being
initiated.</p>

<p class='c008'>The election of Governor Thompson and a co-operative
Legislature was the signal for all banks, competitive business
houses and money loaners to draw in their loans and
investments, as far as possible, and many of those who were
engaged in the various lines mentioned proposed to depart
from the state. In such cities as Boise City, Shoshone,
Ketchem and a few others of like description the saloon
men and money loaners endeavored to sell out and leave the
state at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>The banks refused to make any new loans and insisted
upon the immediate payment of such indebtedness as was
then due. The railroad companies began a course of discrimination
against the people of the state and business
houses reduced their stocks of goods. Money, gold, silver
and paper, became very scarce.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boise City, the capital, before January 1st was in a condition
of business paralysis. As for the several Co-operators,
who made up the Legislature and occupied other government
positions, they had no money—that is, United
States gold, silver and paper. Their entire exchange consisted
of the orders and checks already described. It was
evident that they would not be able to pay cash for what
they purchased in Boise and the merchants and other business
men realized as early as December that they were not
likely to reap a harvest from the new administration.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was also anticipated by the Department of Commerce
at Co-opolis, and an agent of the Legislative Council
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>was sent down to Boise, who speedily closed a trade for a lot
of land on Boise’s principal street. Then came carloads of
lumber from Co-opolis, and a force of Co-opolitan carpenters
was speedily at work, even in the dead of winter, constructing
a good, substantial and commodious three-story-high
building. One-half of this building was a hotel and
one-half a department store. By January 1st such was the
energy displayed by the Co-opolitan workmen that it was
completed and furnished and the store part was stocked
with a large assortment of groceries, hardware, cutlery,
drugs, clothing, dry goods, fancy goods, millinery, fruit,
meats, boots and shoes, dairy products and many other of
the manufactures and products of Co-opolis and the Co-opolitan
farm.</p>

<p class='c008'>This, to a very large extent, solved the problem of comfort
and supplies for our representatives. The orders and
checks of the Association were all good at the hotel and
store. A few motorcycles with runners and others without
and some horses and carriages were provided later on. The
inferiority of the streets and roads in and around Boise at
that time made horses indispensable in the conveyance of
passengers in the winter time. The department stores undersold
every other business and in a very short time its
trade from the citizens and from the surrounding country
was enormous. The competitive stores could not compete
with them. The same was true of the hotel. The table
creaked with the finest of Co-opolitan foods and delicacies
prepared by the most expert of Co-opolitan cooks. The
service at the hotel was excellent, the beds were clean and
soft, and the attention given by our hotel attendants made
up for the somewhat temporary character of the buildings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding the complete prostration of town business
and the absence of work for workmen, skilled and unskilled,
the farmer and the cattle men around Boise began
almost immediately to realize that it was an advantage to
them. They obtained all manufactured goods at our department
store cheaper than ever before. They were also
able to exchange their products for department store wares.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The wheat, corn, oats and other staple products of the farm
and cattle from the ranges still found as good a market
abroad as ever and commanded as good prices. That was
not saying very much, however, for prices everywhere ruled
low.</p>

<p class='c008'>State, municipal, county and other public bonds depreciated
until their value was scarcely more than nominal.
Miners and cattle men were nearly the only classes who
were now able to pay taxes, and both classes were notoriously
expert in evading this duty by false statements of
their wealth. It was evident that before another year
passed, if Idaho depended upon the money of the United
States in circulation within her jurisdiction, for the payment
of public expenses, that her condition was one of
hopeless bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c008'>This condition did not much interest the rank and file
of the Co-operators, because they were well satisfied with
their labor-credit checks and industrial orders, which enabled
them to obtain all they needed, even money, under
certain restrictions. But the individualists were in despair
and many of them emigrated with their flocks and herds to
Wyoming. Others who considered that their holdings in
Idaho were too valuable to leave, not understanding the Co-operators’
plans, contented themselves with abusing what
they called the stupidity of the administration. They knew
it was the unalterable purpose of our people never to issue
public bonds and this was the only method of raising money
for public uses of which they had any knowledge. Some of
them proposed the issuance of warrants upon the treasury,
bearing interest after demand, but this was immediately rejected.</p>

<p class='c008'>The proposition was made by one prominent individualist
newspaper to issue treasury notes to circulate as
money, but this was at once declared impracticable as being
an encroachment upon the authority of the Federal government
to coin money and the provision of the Federal constitution
prohibiting the emission by the states of bills of
credit. Turning then to state-bank issues the individualist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>found no encouragement from that quarter, as he was confronted
by the Federal tax of ten per cent of such issues.
Be it noted, however, that some of the bankers were inclined
to favor the issue of state-bank notes and strongly
advised that it be done, arguing that it was better to have
money with the ten per cent tax rather than no money at
all. But the administration simply declared that Co-operators
did not feel the scarcity of money and a far better plan
than any proposed would doubtless be discovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Legislature remained in session just thirty days.
Very few new laws were enacted. Of those which were enacted,
the reduction of all salaries of public officials one-half,
the law providing for a constitutional convention, the delegates
to which were to have no compensation except traveling
expenses, the abolition of several offices, such as insurance
commissioner, labor commissioner, etc., the repeal of
the law authorizing corporations and the enactment of a
law respecting the organization of Co-operative Associations
and their regulation, were the most important. Some appropriations
were made, but it was admitted to be one of
the most economical sessions ever held by any legislative
body, so far as results to the state were concerned. The
law reducing salaries one-half, although not strictly applicable
to existing officials, was effective because all Co-operators
in office willingly complied with it, and that general
compliance influenced individualists to do likewise.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION AND ITS LABORS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The constitutional convention was set for July 4th, 1903
at Co-opolis. The election was held two weeks before that
time. Few individualists were anxious to become delegates
because the honor was unaccompanied by compensation,
and for the further reason the majority of Co-operators was
now overwhelming. The result was that the same proportion
of Co-operators obtained in the convention as in the
Legislature and it was evident that the progress of the Co-operative
Commonwealth would be carried out. When the
convention met it was called to order by the Governor, a
portion of whose address on that occasion is well worthy of
repetition. After tracing briefly the history of Co-opolis
and the Brotherhood of the Co-operative Commonwealth,
in glowing language, he took up the question of the Co-operative
Constitution and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gentlemen: You are the men in whose wisdom the
state of Idaho confides and upon whose action here the fate
of unknown generations hangs. I would not presume to
advise you with regard to your all-important mission, but
I shall ask permission to offer, with the greatest humility
and with all respect for your high intelligence, a few simple
suggestions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The burden of all I have to say can be aptly phrased in
the somewhat homely language borrowed from the street.
Do not put your state in a ‘strait jacket.’ Do not think
it necessary to prohibit, restrict, define and dogmatize when
you come to make your constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When you have provided a system of state government
and made clean and emphatic the boundaries of executive,
legislative and judicial power, consider that you have completed
your work. Do not undertake to guard the inalienable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>rights of man by introducing details, methods and
systems into your constitution. Leave all that to the common
sense and common justice of the people. Let your
Legislature dominate both the executive and judiciary.
That body is designed, or should be, to express the popular
will. The judiciary is designed to interpret that will as expressed.
The executive is to carry that will into effect.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Governor’s address did not advance further into the
province of the convention. He spoke, for the most part,
in a merry vein, as if he felt that even if the success of his
work was not yet achieved it had nearly passed the stage of
experimentation, and when he concluded the convention,
while impressed with the importance of its great mission,
appeared to share in their leader’s satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The convention continued in session one week. The
result of its work was a constitution, brief, clear and simple.
It provided for executive and legislative departments.
No judiciary was provided for. It prescribed the duties of
the executive department and provided for its branches.
The first Governor of Idaho was to hold office for a period
of three years and all Governors succeeding for seven years
each. He was the chief executive of the state and his duty
was to see that the law was enforced.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were to be a Secretary of State, State Auditor,
State Treasurer, Attorney-General and Secretary of Co-operative
Industries. The duties of these several officials
were such as ordinarily attached to such officials, except that
of Secretary of Co-operative Industries. It was the duty
of this official to keep a full record of all Co-operative Associations
in the state, their rules and by-laws, and to use
his best endeavors to bring about a complete union of all
under one head. He was also to be the active general of
the militia of the state and superintend all operations of
that body, subject to the order of the Governor. The Great
Council possessed all legislative and judicial power. The
legislative power could not be delegated, but was restricted
and controlled by the people as follows: When twenty per
cent of the voting population of the state should petition to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>have any law, whether on the statute books or not, submitted
to popular vote, the Governor’s duty was to submit
it at the annual election held in October of each year.</p>

<p class='c008'>A majority vote was sufficient to enact or repeal such
law.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was also provided that if twenty per cent of the population
should petition the President to remove any official
from office the question of such removal should be submitted
to the popular vote at the next annual election, and a
majority vote was sufficient to retain or remove such official.
In case such officer was removed by popular vote the
Governor was to appoint a successor to hold until the next
annual election, but the person removed could not hold the
office again until one full term had intervened. The Legislature
had power to delegate its judicial functions in such
manner as it saw fit.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it was desired to remove the Governor the petition
must be submitted to the Great Council and in case of his
removal the vacancy was filled by that body.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the convention adjourned its labors had produced
the briefest written constitution in force in any of the
states of the American Union. In my opinion it was the
best. It not only made the legislative body the most prominent
of the people’s servants, but it provided a plain and
simple method for the exercise of such control. It provided
a strong executive to execute the laws and made him
the commander-in-chief of the militia of the state, both
industrial and military, but it gave him no veto or pardoning
power. It was, however, his province to recommend to
the Great Council the pardon of persons sentenced by the
judiciary to punishment, and few instances are known to
our history where such recommendations were not acted
upon favorably. It contained one brief provision which
expresses all that is best in modern civilized government in
a few words. That provision, under the head of Co-operation,
is as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Council shall provide for the government ownership
of all the sources and machinery of production and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>operation of the same, to the end that no person within the
state shall be idle or needy. It shall cause all railroads,
water rights, mines and cultivated or uncultivated lands to
be purchased by the state as speedily as practicable and
shall levy an army, to be known as the Industrial Army, to
work the same. The state shall never sell, grant or alienate
any of its property so acquired. No property shall be taken
from any person or persons by the state without paying just
compensation therefor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>All the laws in force at the time of the adoption of the
new constitution, except such as were inconsistent with it,
were to be continued in force until amended or repealed.
All officials, except those whose offices were abolished by
the new constitution, or should be abolished by the Great
Council, continued in office until the next general election.</p>

<p class='c008'>The constitutional election was held the third Monday
in August, 1903, and resulted in the adoption of this new
instrument. By its terms the old system of legislation being
abolished, the Governor was authorized to convene the
first session of the Great Council the first Monday in January,
1904. An election was called for November, and at
that election the Great Council, consisting of one hundred
and ninety members, representing as nearly as possible one
for each one thousand voters, were elected. All but thirty
were Co-operators. There was no doubt now that the new
state and the new system were, for a time at least, established.
The machinery of government was in our hands
and the future rested with us.</p>

<p class='c008'>The world beyond Idaho did not apparently concern
itself with us or our system. The defeat of the opposition
which had, in the election of 1902, attacked us with bitterness,
resulted in that opposition subsiding into silence.
The great dailies, magazines and periodicals simply refused
to recognize us, and our system received no notice from the
capitalist world. This was annoying to some of the Co-operators,
both in and out of Idaho, because we felt that
we were ignored and that our merits ought to be proclaimed.
I remember some of our members of the Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Council expressing dissatisfaction because of this fact in
the presence of Governor Thompson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Merits!” exclaimed he; “what merits have we? We
have simply shown the world that for five years we could
work together and produce wonders. Let us see what we
can do as lawmakers. Let us show what we can do with a
state after we have captured it. If we make some blunders
you need not flatter yourselves that you are unobserved.
If you build a strong and substantial state you need not
fear that the world will overlook that fact. The truth is
that all the capital, intellect and classes of America are
watching for signs of disagreement and dismembership.
They will be disappointed if they do not find them, but
when you are on a solid basis then they will proclaim your
system a wonder and philosophers will come to observe and
study it. We ought to bear all this in mind as we proceed
to the work of making proper laws for the regulation of
this state. Our history is just begun and it rests with us
whether it will continue.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>DEPARTMENT STORES IN THE COMPETITIVE SYSTEM—DEPARTMENT STORES IN CO-OPERATION—THE CO-OPOLITAN ASSOCIATION DISCOVERS THE VALUE OF THE DEPARTMENT STORE AS A WEAPON OF WARFARE—THE DEATH OF OLD BOISE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The latter part of the nineteenth century saw strange
and novel influences at work in the competitive system of
the civilized world. The great advantages accruing from
co-operation had become apparent, in those days, to a
few, and these employed its methods to a limited extent to
acquire vast fortunes for themselves. Such were corporations,
trusts, great combinations of capital, department
stores and syndicates. These concerns, establishing themselves
in every industrial center, absorbed nearly every industry.
It was impossible for the individual, the small capitalist,
the man, to compete with such institutions, and yet
those who were the greatest gainers from them were the
most zealous advocates of the competitive system. Wanamaker’s
vast department stores in Philadelphia and New
York city were good illustrations of what the co-operative
institution, employed against the competitor<a id='t88'></a>, could accomplish,
both for the one man who owned it and against the
many who were asked to compete with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The owner grew fabulously rich. There was no limit
to his acquisitions and he swallowed up all competitors who
could not do business on the same system. Commercial
house after commercial house fell before Wanamaker. Man
after man became bankrupt, not because he lacked business
ability, or was idle or inattentive, but because he could not
compete with Wanamaker. So it came to pass that in
Wanamaker’s great marvels of industry, the department
stores, some of the brightest, shrewdest and most expert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>business men were serving as managers of departments,
floor walkers, clerks and bookkeepers. It was, indeed, a
vast, ceaseless and mighty army of co-operators intent upon
making the fortune of one man, and with such a combination
competition could not compete.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Idaho our colony accidentally discovered the use to
which they could put this great “idea” which enabled
Wanamaker to conquer the commercial world and force the
princes of industry to become his willing slaves. This was
the undesigned conquest of Boise City by the Co-operative
Commonwealth. When the first Great Council met in
January, 1904, our Co-operative Hotel had absorbed the
entire business of all other hotels in the city.</p>

<p class='c008'>All our productive power was so fully employed that we
were able to furnish board and lodging for a small sum, of
a quality such as few hotels in cities of a hundred thousand
persons offered their guests. Our department store was
equally successful.</p>

<p class='c008'>It cost us nothing to advertise.</p>

<p class='c008'>We painted no signs.</p>

<p class='c008'>We paid no rents.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only expense we incurred was the labor we expended,
and labor was as plentiful as humanity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides this, we employed labor-saving machinery without
stint, and thereby multiplied the enormous power of
co-operative labor many times.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were better and more powerfully prepared to destroy
competition than Wanamaker, because we had no expenses
and wasted neither time nor money in inviting trade.</p>

<p class='c008'>We sold daily the best wares and produce which we could
manufacture or procure. The excellence of our stocks,
together with the smallness of our prices, was our recommendation.</p>

<p class='c008'>We intensified by our establishment in Boise City the
well-known effects of the department store in competitive
cities.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the trade came to us.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing could compete with our system, and merchants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and hotel men were compelled to assign for the benefit of
creditors, join the Co-operative Commonwealth or depart
from the state.</p>

<p class='c008'>When our new constitution was adopted the Co-opolitan
Legislative Council made a rule that all persons who were
citizens of the state at that time should be eligible for membership
on the same terms as all other members of the
National Brotherhood. Most of the merchants and hotel
men in Boise City whose occupations were gone chose to
join our body and were assigned to positions in the Co-opolitan
store or some suitable department at Co-opolis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lawyers being largely creatures of competition, nearly
all disappeared, and the few who remained either joined us
and were assigned to the Legal department or if they remained
and did not join engaged in the precarious business
of settling up bankrupt estates.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Association had, with the opening of spring, purchased
a pleasantly located tract of land adjoining the city,
laid it out on the plan of Co-opolis as nearly as could be
done, constructed elegant brick hotel and department store
buildings, built a large number of cottages similar to those
in Co-opolis, and a commodious school building, and provided
water, gas, electric and steam-heating plants. About
November 1st, 1903, the entire Co-opolitan plant in Boise
City, including the industrial force employed, removed to
the new town and old Boise was well nigh deserted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reason for this move is apparent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Boise was burdened by debt which it was no part of
the design or duty of the Co-operative Commonwealth or of
the Co-opolitan colony to pay.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a large bonded municipal debt, a large bonded
water debt and another large school debt.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gas and electric plants were also bonded, but those
were private debts payable only by such as availed themselves
of their advantages.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no way to avoid assuming these public debts
if we continued in the old city.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of our enemies, later on, set up a howl against what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>they termed our immorality in running away from these
obligations. But they were not our obligations. We did
not make them and we certainly had a right to live outside
of the territory affected by them if we chose. In competitive
cities business enterprises and persons of integrity and
fortune usually locate where the public burdens are least
likely to rest heavily upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>While Boise City, that is the collection of town lots,
streets and buildings bearing that historic designation, was
blighted, the collection of people who had done all the work
of building it was immeasurably improved by the Co-operative
accession. A new Boise City had begun to grow up on
the commercial ruins of the old, but the Boston, New York,
St. Louis and Chicago people who held large tracts of land
around about and in the city were not benefited by this
change. New Boise did not help them. Indeed, their land
depreciated in price daily.</p>

<p class='c008'>The banks of old Boise all went into liquidation and
made frantic efforts to collect their debts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Money loaners did the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>Insurance agents either fled from the blight or came
to us.</p>

<p class='c008'>Saloonkeepers, speculators in land, dance-hall proprietors,
persons whose methods of gaining a livelihood were
illegal, women of ill reputation and gamblers all departed
for lands unknown.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the competitive point of view this hegira was regarded
as a fatal blow to old Boise. Useless as were their
occupations to the production or even distribution of
wealth, they had been deemed necessary, because they lured
money into the city, and this money, being collected in fines
from one class and taxes from another class, went to help
pay interest on public bonds. Many a pious holder of
municipal bonds would be shocked to learn that but for the
toleration of criminal and disgusting practices in the
bonded city the bond would be well nigh worthless. Yet
such was the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Legislative Council of the city of Co-opolis took full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>notice of the situation at Boise and after visiting and
viewing the city felt and expressed great pleasure. It was
our first venture into a competitive city, and at the outset
we had entertained some misgivings as to the probabilities
of a success. But the seeming necessity of providing accommodations
for a Co-operative Legislature forced us to enter
Boise City and the results were astonishing. The profits
were immense, and it was now evident that the co-operative
system was not only a powerful developer of a new and hitherto
unoccupied country, but that in very truth it was invincible
in the very center of competition. Honesty,
justice and fraternity, in combination with industry, were
unconquerable, and left no room for the gambler, the speculator,
the panderer or the drone. This discovery having
been made, the Legislative Council announced its purpose
to place a department store and hotel in every city in the
state, but to proceed cautiously, so as not to diminish the
annual dividends of members.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the employment of this great industrial force it
was believed the citizens of Idaho would speedily be
brought to enlist in and share the benefits of the Co-operative
Commonwealth. And events have proved the belief
correct.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'>OUR NEW REVENUE SYSTEM—CONSTITUTIONAL BATTLE OVER BILLS OF CREDIT—MONEY IN IDAHO—CONFLICTS WITH CATTLE MEN AND MINE OWNERS—CO-OPERATION AGAINST THE FIELD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Great Council of 1904 readjusted our legal system
to conform to the new constitution and the co-operative
programme. The political subdivision of the state into
counties was not disturbed and local government of these
was delegated to county commissioners. What had been
variously denominated home rule and local option was,
however, greatly extended.</p>

<p class='c008'>Counties were permitted to determine for themselves
many questions which by the old system were within the
exclusive province of the Legislature. No county or other
subdivision of the state was permitted to issue bonds for any
purpose nor to expend in any one year more than the total
amount received in taxes. But each county had the option
to pay the state tax in money or in the products of labor.
Where a county voted to pay taxes in the products of labor
it was required to maintain as many store houses as were
necessary to properly and securely store its receipts.</p>

<p class='c008'>The law provided that the Great Council should annually
elect a commission consisting of five members, whose
duty it was to meet at the capital city in October of each
year and determine the value of the various products of the
state. The cereals, for instance, were to be valued at so
much per bushel, vegetables and fruit at so much per
pound, precious metals at so much per ounce, wool, hides,
furs and other raw material at such prices as were fixed in
the schedule prepared by the commission. All articles
named in the schedule were to be received in lieu of money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and at the prices fixed, so long as that schedule remained in
force.</p>

<p class='c008'>This plan would have been impracticable had it not been
for the fact that the Legislative Council of Co-opolis agreed
to take all produce so received for taxes at the schedule
price therefor. The latter, for its own protection, placed a
department store in every county seat, where, under its
contract, it reserved all perishable property and either sold
it in the proper department of its local store or shipped it at
once to a suitable market. The schedule prices were sufficiently
low to protect the Co-opolitan Association from loss.
As for hides, furs, wool and other raw material, and staple
agricultural products, they were carefully inspected by Co-opolitan
commissioners at the receiving department store
or warehouse, and, if not of schedule standard, were not
accepted. In this manner and by this system all producers
were able to pay their taxes without being compelled to
borrow money and in the very wealth which their industry
produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>All public expenses were defrayed and all salaries were
paid in the products of labor. The salary of a judge, for
instance, amounting to twelve hundred dollars per annum,
neither more nor less than a Co-opolitan received as his
annual dividend, was paid by the state in orders or credit
checks for goods or whatever the Co-opolitan Association
had to sell. Such orders were of various denominations
and in the following form:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To the Co-opolitan Association:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Deliver to the bearer hereof goods, wares, merchandise,
entertainment or services of the value of one dollar and
charge the same to the State of Idaho.</p>

<table class='table0'>
<colgroup>
<col />

</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td class='c009'>Jacob Wirth,</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>Secretary.</td>
    <td class='c012'>Governor.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'>This method of collecting taxes and paying state expenses
proved fully equal to the emergency. The Co-opolitan
Association lost nothing by it. All schedule prices
were fixed, as I have already stated, at a figure which was
slightly lower than the cash market price for non-perishable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and staple products and still lower for produce generally
considered perishable.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the producer also found his advantage to consist in
the facility with which it enabled him to meet his public
dues at all times promptly, thus avoiding penalties, interest
and expenses. The system had not been long in operation
before a question arose, concerning these orders, with the
Federal authorities, who, at first, pronounced the Co-opolitan
Association a kind of a banking institution, and the
state orders upon it devices in the nature of state-bank
issues. The effort was then made to compel the Co-opolitan
Association to pay the ten per cent tax imposed by the
Federal law on such issues.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question was never brought into the courts, because
the most eminent and expert lawyers in the Union agreed
that such orders could no more be regarded as money than
the checks of business men upon their bank deposits, the
promissory notes of debtors, the tickets of transportation
companies and the time checks of mining and other large
corporations controlling labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another question arose of a more serious character upon
the right of the state to emit “Bills of Credit.” This the
Federal constitution prohibited. A test case was made
upon one of the state orders and taken to the United States
Supreme Court. The decision of that tribunal was rendered
by a divided court, a majority being of opinion that
they could not be regarded as coming within the prohibition
of the constitution referred to. These orders, the
court held, were not designed to circulate as money, because
they were directed to a private association of individuals
designated as the Co-opolitan Association, and simply directed
such association to deliver goods to the bearer. It
was not a promise on the part of the state to pay money, nor
to deliver goods. It was to be honored on demand, and
when received by the Association in question was forthwith
canceled. Evidence was offered by the parties seeking to
void the orders that as a matter of fact they did circulate
as money. This was held to be immaterial, for the reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>that the fact, if shown, would not tend to prove that such
was the intention of the state. The truth was that very few
of the state orders so circulated. They were usually presented
to the Co-opolitan store at any county seat without
intermediate transfer, and a labor-credit check or industrial
orders were issued instead.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is true that such industrial orders so circulated and
were treated as money by the people of Idaho, but the practice
was not encouraged by Co-operators, because it was an
incident of individualism and not of co-operation. Their
circulation could not be prevented so long as the co-operative
plan embraced the purchase of all property owned
or produced by individualists in the state, and payment on
goods or property as represented by these orders. In 1904
more than one-half of the people of the state were members
of the Co-opolitan Association, and great numbers of those
who were not members were daily becoming so. It was believed
that in time our industrial orders would cease to circulate
and perhaps be entirely superseded by the labor-credit
check. It should be borne in mind that the labor-credit
check, not being transferable, never passed out of the
hands of its owner.</p>

<p class='c008'>The policy of Idaho and the Co-opolitan Association was
to prevent, as far as possible, the circulation of money in
the state. It was treated as if it were a kind of poison
which produced among men most dreadful diseases, and
at the same time was an instrument of moral, financial and
social ruin. We were fully convinced, when Co-opolis was
founded, that if co-operation was to succeed some system
must be applied which would exclude money from use
among Co-operators. But it was recognized that outside
of Idaho money was and must continue to remain king, as
long as the industrial competitive and individualist system
governed their affairs. For this reason the Co-opolitan
Legislative Council accepted money, but sought in every
possible way to prevent its circulation.</p>

<p class='c008'>All money obtained by the sale of surplus products,
manufactures or property of any kind in other states, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>which might come into the co-operative stores, was immediately
turned over to the Legislative Council and by it deposited
in a strong safe in the basement of the Council Hall.
Here it was guarded as if it were a deadly peril to the public
weal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The safe in which it rested was opened by a combination
known only to the President, and it stood in an iron chamber
whose great lock was turned by a key held by one of
the Council. This was enclosed in another iron chamber
which was opened only by a different key held by another
member of the Council. There were twenty-six chambers
of different sizes, the smaller enclosed within the larger,
and twenty-six locks opened by as many different keys, each
councilor holding one and no more. It took twenty-six
councilors and twenty-six keys to reach the safe, and no
money could be taken from it except in the presence of at
least one-half of the members of the Legislative Council.
But it was a rule of the Association that if any person living
in the state desired money with which to travel outside of
the state he should make his affidavit to that effect setting
forth the amount he desired, and upon his application for
such an amount, if the Council were satisfied that it was
made in good faith and that the money would not be expended
in the state, the application was granted. Articles
which the Department of Commerce were compelled to
import from other states or countries were also paid for
from the accumulation in the safe.</p>

<p class='c008'>After disposing of the question of how taxes and public
expenses could be discharged the first Great Council took
up the question of what property should be taxable.
Among the private individualist enterprises in Idaho mining
and grazing predominated. Both the mine owners and
cattle men, whose herds were permitted to wander at will on
the ranges, were expert “tax dodgers.” How to reach them
and compel them to pay their just and fair proportion of
the expense of running the state and maintaining the
schools was an important question. It was decided that all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>taxes should be levied on land values. In other words, what
is sometimes called the Single-Tax system was adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wherever cattle men occupied a range together the total
number of cattle upon it was determined, owners’ names
were obtained and the value of the range per acre was estimated
upon the basis of its use for grazing purposes. Each
owner was then made liable for the tax on the total acreage
of the range occupied, and the proportion each was bound
to pay was no question for the state, but was a question for
the cattle men to determine for and among themselves.
Cattle men now found it impossible to escape their taxes as
formerly, each being zealous to require his neighbor to pay
his part, and it must be confessed that they showed a strong
disposition to leave the state, so that the ranges abandoned
by them were left for the use of our herds.</p>

<p class='c008'>It ought to be said, however, that the cattle owners did
not abandon the state without a fight. They resisted the
collection of taxes, claiming the system to be unjust and
against public policy. One of the trial courts decided in
their favor, but the case was appealed to the Great Council,
which, it will be remembered, retained the Supreme Judicial
authority in itself. The matter was referred by this
body to six of its members, all lawyers, and indeed the only
lawyers in the Great Council, all of whom were Co-operators,
and the trial court was reversed. There was also an
armed resistance to the collection of the tax, but the cattle
men were speedily put to rout, the state militia suffering
no other loss than three men wounded. The newspaper
press throughout the Union, however, took sides with the
cattle men, claiming that the system of taxation had been
adopted for the sole purpose of driving these “honest” men
from the state and taking possession of “their” ranges. The
truth was that the men who left the state on account of this
law did so to escape honest burdens and went where the
laws were more unjust, or if not unjust not effectual to
prevent the shifting of such burdens dishonestly to other
shoulders which ought not to bear them. We offered no
encouragement to dishonest practices, and if our failure to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>do so was an advantage to some other state which did, we
certainly had no occasion to feel envious.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mining property owned by corporations or associations
was valued at the full par of its capital stock and assessed
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the policy of the state not to encourage the mining
of the precious minerals by private enterprise. The miners
of the state were fast becoming absorbed in our Co-opolitan
Association and wages had risen to nearly four
dollars per day for skilled or unskilled workers, because a
membership in the Co-opolitan Association or its Industrial
Army paid that amount annually.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mine owners sought to obviate what they called the evil
of high wages by importing cheaper labor. At first they
attempted the introduction of Chinese miners and later an
ignorant class of Italians, Hungarians and Slavonians. Our
Great Council prohibited aliens from owning, holding or
acquiring real estate or making investments of any kind
within the state on and after the date of the passage of a
law to that effect. It also prohibited the importation of
aliens into the state as laborers, or the employment of any
such by any person, association or corporation.</p>

<p class='c008'>These laws were all held to be valid and constitutional
by the Supreme Court of the United States, which some
years after their passage had occasion to pass upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The result was that capital engaged in mining in Idaho
withdrew and some of the mines were purchased at a low
figure and operated by the Co-opolitan Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here again the press of the United States denounced
the immorality of the Co-operative Commonwealth, because
of its oppressive conduct toward capital. Immoral indeed!</p>

<p class='c008'>Idaho simply made laws which in other states or countries
have never been disapproved as immoral.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Co-opolitan Association gave to labor the same high
wages in all its departments, and in that manner made laborers
anxious to join the Association. This left the mine
owner to do his own work or pay as much as the worker
could earn as a Co-operator.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The capitalist could not compete in the labor market
with labor itself, when labor employed its skill and force
in its own behalf. If the mine which was made to produce
wealth for capital and peril, distress and death for labor,
became valueless, because there was no longer a force to
work it, whose fault was that?</p>

<p class='c008'>We did not steal the gold which glistened in its dark
caverns!</p>

<p class='c008'>We did not rob the capitalist of the labor which he
owned!</p>

<p class='c008'>The labor of men and women was not his vested right,
like his mine. He had preached the merits of competition
and we had simply competed for and won the labor force
that dug his mine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the mine was worthless because the men who made
it would no longer work it. What did the Co-opolitan Association
do which was immoral? Having taken its labor
force and set it at work for itself, this mine had no value
except if the labor force could be restored to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Capital could not do it. The Co-opolitan Association
could. We purchased it for what it was worth without the
labor force, which nobody owned. We could never have
done this if capital had been able to work that same force
and steal its products. Yet the newspaper press of that day
denounced us as immoral and was effusive in its praise of
the competitive system.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Great Council at this session provided for a Supreme
Judicial Court and as many County Courts as there were
counties. The purpose of this system was to secure the
proper administration of justice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Supreme Court was not authorized to decide any
question of the constitutionality of a law enacted by the
Great Council adversely, but if in their opinion such law
was unconstitutional they were required to certify the same,
with their reasons, to the Great Council for review. The
jury system was preserved, with the exception that in civil
cases a majority of the jury decided. Many radical changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>were effected by this Great Council, but those mentioned
were the most sweeping.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Great Council of 1904, perhaps because it was unhandicapped
by precedents, was the most memorable, for
the swiftness and merit of its legislative work, of any session
which has occurred since. Its successors had been, in
a very marked degree, required by public sentiment to conform
to its standards.</p>

<p class='c008'>Humanity, as all history proves, when once it accepts a
system, whether good or bad, is loath to abandon it, and
permits it to be changed only when the necessity for change
is made apparent by experiences often of the most distressing
nature. For this reason revolution has rarely ever produced
lasting results except in the mere form, and not in
the substance and spirit of things. If it be contended that
society has undergone great changes in those respects let
it be remembered that evolution, not revolution, did it.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <span class='large'>MISS CAROLINE WOODBERRY AGAIN—THE WEST PARISH—PUBLICATION OF MISS WOODBERRY’S NOVEL—MARRIAGE—WE VISIT NEW ENGLAND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Long before the year 1904 drew to its close a great
change had taken place in my life. The feminine disposition
of my aunt to make matrimonial matches had been
successful in throwing me into the society of Miss Caroline
Woodberry and after the ride to Canyon Lake, of which I
have already made mention, I was with her whenever leisure
and opportunity permitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Co-opolis there were in all seasons amusements and
entertainments of every kind, and if we tired of one we were
not at a loss for diversion which, while it could not increase
the happiness I found in the young lady’s society, aided me
in administering to her pleasure. Society in Co-opolis was
even then refined and intelligent. I do not mean to leave
the impression that our people had in six years acquired
all the arts and foibles which fashionable society in eastern
cities mistake for refinement, but it really was wonderful
to see what improvement prosperity had produced in the
manner, bearing and language of most of our people.
While it is possible that such prosperity in the competitive
system, would have caused many to develop the worst
traits of their character, yet the absence of all opportunity
to amass a fortune in speculation or by gambling methods in
the co-operative system insured to each the enjoyment of his
own portion. Nobody was or could be purse proud. Nobody
was or could be dependent upon charity. Nobody had
occasion to be ashamed of his material condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Good clothes, ornaments, books, pleasant homes and all
the conveniences of modern life were within the reach of
all.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Humanity is so constituted, however, that its members
must compete, contend and battle with one another.</p>

<p class='c008'>What shall be the field for this competition? Over what
shall the race contend? Where shall be the battle ground?</p>

<p class='c008'>Some philosophers in times past taught that the race must
fall into decay, dwindle into weakness and lose individuality
if it was removed from the struggle for potatoes, meat
and coffee. They, perhaps, honestly believed that it was
fatal to progress to raise mankind to an elevated plane and
let the battle be waged for moral, intellectual and perhaps
spiritual supremacy. In Co-opolis our system eliminated
the mere material world as an object of competition, and
pursuing the law of our nature, we sought to excel in intellectual
pursuits, matters of taste, athletics and what tended
to personal improvement. It was not long before the Co-opolitan
began to be known as being possessed of good
manners, taste in matters of dress and even polish. These
were not pronounced characteristics for many years after,
but I sometimes thought I could see them developing. One
people from whom, in part, at least, the incentive to acquire
and own things had been largely removed, lost in a measure
the cheating, lying, cunning and overreaching habits of
that delusive and obstructing thing called business. Co-opolitans,
six years after the city was founded, habitually
told one another the truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sets and circles existed then, as now, in Co-opolitan society.
Men and women always will choose their own companions
and some common interest will always operate to form
them into associations. If some of the potato diggers discover
that potato digging is not all there is of life those will probably
come to recognize in one another kindred spirits whose
kinship is closer than that of the uninitiated and the circle
is evolved. I was one of a circle or set and Miss Woodberry
was a member of that circle, too. There were literary gatherings,
card parties, socials and all sorts of meetings in winter,
and lawn parties, dinners, dances and all sorts of pleasures
in summer. It must be admitted that our social circle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>was generally regarded as somewhat select in a literary
sense, because some of the brightest minds in Co-opolis were
members. This did not exclude us from the pleasures
which I have mentioned, but it gave our circle a somewhat
sombre rather than gay reputation. We were just as popular,
however, as any other set, and by no means assumed to
be better than our neighbors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Woodberry was not a member of the Industrial
Army, and one of the great questions which we often discussed
was whether she should become such. This question
grew more than ever urgent when we decided that we were
sufficiently attached to each other to become husband and
wife. Attached to each other! That sounds and reads
mechanical enough to describe the gluing together of two
blocks of wood, and I have no doubt that because this is,
in the main, an historical work and only incidentally biographical,
it is all the warmth I am expected to express.
I beg pardon! But this lady has been my wife now
thirty years and a better wife no mortal man ever had.
Attached to her! Why! I was so thoroughly and passionately
devoted to her that I came very near incurring the
censure of my department associates and being subjected to
the operation of the Imperative Mandate on the charge of
inattention to business, but escaped, because, as I suppose,
“the whole world loves a lover,” and my attachment was not
successfully concealed. Be that as it may, after we were
engaged to be married, Miss Woodberry became curious to
know what her fate would be; she had accepted me without
much regard to consequences. Now, after the acceptance,
when the consequences were close at hand, she became more
solicitous to understand her position. She had only been a
visitor in Co-opolis and had been a guest of the Prestons,
whom I have already described as my near neighbors. During
this visit she had been engaged in writing a novel,
which she read as the chapters were completed to me. I
was impressed with its merit and believed some of its passages
breathed the spirit of genius. However, although I
judged myself a dispassionate and unsparing critic, I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>not trust my judgment upon the production of one who was
prejudiced in her favor. I persuaded her to allow me to
submit her manuscript to a committee of my department
for its criticism, with a view to arranging for its publication
under the auspices of the Co-opolitan Association. As this
committee had proven whenever it deemed a work sufficiently
meritorious to warrant it, to proceed with its publication
and defray the expenses from the so-called publication
fund, it occurred to me that, if my judgment should
be approved, this novel could be published by our department
and would distinguish the admission of its author into
the Association. We had, up to that time, never undertaken
the publication of a novel, but our plant was sufficiently
extensive and commodious to enable us to do so.
Hitherto we were contented to confine our publications to
text books for our schools, a monthly magazine devoted to
co-operation, the Daily Co-opolitan and a large number of
pamphlets. To my great joy the committee, composed of
the very brightest literary men in the city, including our
educational chief, Mr. Edmunds, pronounced it a production
of such merit as to be worthy of publication at the
public expense. I had not disclosed to them the name of
the author and they supposed it was some member.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the evening of the day when this decision was communicated
to me I went over to the Preston cottage to see
my affianced and tell her the result of my venture with the
committee. She was delighted with the news. It was her
first novel, and to find that the committee had received it
with favor was an event which, as she often told me, gave
her more genuine pleasure than anything ever did before
or has since. We spent an hour or more that evening talking
over the novel, its characters and plot.</p>

<p class='c008'>The name was “The West Parish.” The opening scene
was laid in the West Parish of Gloucester, Cape Ann,
Essex County, Massachusetts. There were, as everybody
knows, wonderful descriptions of white sandy beaches, the
blue old ocean, ships sailing, marshes and sea birds a-wing.
There were two little boys and an old aunt. The former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>were orphans, the latter infirm and impoverished, but doing
her best, which was as bad as could be, to keep the little
ones alive. Their father had been a railroad engineer, but
a series of misfortunes deprived him of his savings, and
then, in one of the perils common to his dangerous employment,
he was killed and the mother soon after died.</p>

<p class='c008'>These little ones, without means and without the sympathy
of the multitudes, who, in their desperation in the
struggle for bread, forgot or did not see them, were sent to
this aunt. That poor old woman had griefs enough of her
own. Her life was well nigh worked out. She had neither
nerves nor strength. Her limbs were stiff and rheumatic.
Her eyes were dim and her aged back was bent. In her
mean little cottage by the roadside at Annisquan she had all
she could do to nurse the fading embers of her life’s fires,
and she was now expected to support these two little infants,
one three and one five years of age. She was cross
to them, but she did not mean to be. She was very impatient
and she did not know it. She did not take them
into her arms as a mother would, but that never occurred to
her. And yet she loved them, but the power of expressing
love had long been crushed out by poverty.</p>

<p class='c008'>So one day these two ragged, half-fed little boys, with
their tear-bestained cheeks and great eyes, made more expressive
by being set in the pale faces pinched by want,
started out from the old aunt’s house in search of a place
their mother used to tell them about which was called
Heaven, where she said their papa was. The children were
afterward found nearly starved to death lying near the
roadside seven miles from home by some charitably disposed
persons, who fed them and subsequently caused them
to be placed in an orphan asylum, where they were kept
and given a meagre education suitable to their lowly financial
condition. When they were large and strong enough
they were sent to the West and placed in the charge of
farmers, but were widely separated. The author traced the
development of each. Both were naturally possessed of
powerful minds. One became a money maker, the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>the champion of a new system for the development of his
race. One was a great banker and amassed millions. The
other was a great co-operator and occupied a high station
in the Co-operative Commonwealth. She carried her story
into the future that she might picture conditions which
had not yet obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>In those days it was a favorite method of illustrating
economic principles, and had been made quite fashionable
by Bellamy’s famous work called “Looking Backward.”
Miss Woodberry’s novel was not so remarkable for its plot
as for the vivid contrast which it presented between the
competitive and co-operative system, and so powerfully did
her pen draw the picture that while the brother who gave
his life to the one, though not worse than most of its supporters,
seemed possessed of a demon of greed; the brother
who gave his life to the other appeared to be no more nor
less than a man. This novel seemed to me then, as it does
now, both instructive and artistic and equal to any of those
which my wife has written since.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What shall we do now?” asked Miss Woodberry. “You
have obtained a favorable criticism and the Association will
publish the novel. What advantage will it give me or you
to do so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall urge you first to make an application for membership,”
I replied. “Although you were not a citizen of
Idaho nor a member of the National Brotherhood, you will
find that your accomplishments and this novel will gain you
immediate admission.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes!” exclaimed she. “But what else? Does not the
Co-opolitan Association provide for some reward for a
meritorious work?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Co-opolitan Association will endeavor to be just,”
I replied. “In the case of Dupont, the man who invented
the Dupont motorcycle, which has brought us a large accession
of wealth, the Legislative Council has allowed him
a five years’ furlough and he is now traveling in Europe,
but draws his full pay on the Industrial Army. Dupont has
decided to take only one year now and then the rest of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>time hereafter. Then there is Dr. James, who received a
furlough of three months and an advance of $1,200.00
from his next three years’ pay, for special merit and extraordinary
services of a professional character. We have a
system of rewarding those who display special merit or who
by some new invention add to the wealth, comfort or
power of the Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our Legislative Council requests each department chief
to present, every three months, the names of members most
deserving of reward, and after fully and fairly informing
themselves as to the work, art or production recommended,
dispenses its rewards according to its best judgment. At the
last meeting of the Legislative Council for this purpose ten
men in my department were rewarded. One got six weeks
rest, another two months, a third one week and others various
terms of respite. This was in addition to the vacation.
I am not in the habit of selecting these ten myself. I leave
that to my foreman and in doing so avoid jealousies. I
shall not recommend you, but I believe this novel will suggest
to the Legislative Council the propriety of a reward.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This reference to her entering some department suggested
the old discussion again of whether she would apply
or not. She was very much attached to the Association and
believed it would ultimately own the entire state, but she
was not sure, she said, that she ought to become absorbed
in it. We considered that we might marry and that I could
supply the house from my income and she could, if her
novel was successful from a financial point of view, do other
literary work at home and for ourselves. But she was not
committed to this view, nor were her opinions fixed. However,
she finally agreed with me in the belief that her life
could be made far more useful as a member than as an individual.
We agreed that if both were employed by the Association
our united efforts would bring us twenty-four hundred
dollars a year so long as twelve hundred dollars was
each member’s income. I had long before converted all the
property which I had inherited into cash of the gold and
silver kind and had turned it over to the Association with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the understanding that I would be permitted to withdraw
it in amounts not greater than $1,200.00 per annum, if I
so desired. The Association paid nothing for its use, but
agreed to furnish, on the terms stated, goods, wares, labor
checks or orders instead of money, or even money, if the
proper affidavit and application for money was filed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Aunt Lydia had also been economical in expenditures for
the house, so that my expenses for two years had only been
two thousand dollars, and I had a thousand dollars in unexpended
labor-credit checks. This was also left with the
Association, undrawn, so that the Association was indebted
to me in the sum of $11,000.00. My affianced wife, as well
as myself, was anxious to visit Europe and Asia, and this
fund of $11,000.00 we calculated would enable us to do
so without pinching ourselves while abroad. It was not
possible to pinch ourselves at home, because at this time
every department was accomplishing wonders in the production
of wealth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Caroline made her application the next day. Being
neither a citizen of Idaho nor a member of the Brotherhood,
she was obliged to pass an examination as to health,
opinions and wealth. The first was found to be perfect.
The second showed her to be fully acquainted with co-operative
principles and the main features of our peculiar
system. Wealth she had none. But she had what was better
than wealth. She had talent. She had education. She
had some experience in teaching and was a skillful stenographer.
She was accepted and enrolled in the Educational
department. This was in June and her services were not required
until September in that department. She was, however,
placed on the pay roll and given her vacation period
at once. It did not concern the department whether her
school year began or closed with a season of rest. I, too,
was entitled to a vacation of four weeks each year and it was
usual for me to take it in July or August. Ordinarily I spent
it in the vicinity of the great lakes in the northern part of
the state or with parties of excursionists in the mountains.
This year I designed to visit New England and to take with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>me my wife. Caroline was agreeable to this plan and I
made all arrangements accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the latter part of June we were married and on the
very same day, as a part of the celebration, the work of putting
the new novel into type was begun. It was a joyful occasion.
The wedding ceremony was performed at my house
in Co-opolis and Governor Thompson did me the honor to
officiate. It was not a public affair. Members of the Legislative
Council, Governor Thompson and the members of
my departmental staff and their wives were present at the
wedding feast, which was spread at the Co-opolitan Hotel.
That evening my wife and I took a special car at 11:30
o’clock on the Co-opolis Southern Electric Railroad for
Boise City, from which place we went to Nampa, met the
early morning east-bound train on the Union Pacific and
proceeded on our wedding trip.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were absent until the middle of August and were
glad enough to return. I say we were glad to return, but
this does not mean that our trip was unpleasant. We were
like people of refinement who gayly abandon the luxurious
surroundings of a beautiful Christian home and, returning
to the primitive habits of their savage ancestry, descend,
for a short season, to the novelty of camp life. However
enjoyable such life may seem for a season there comes a
time, and that speedily, when the novelty wears off, and life
in the civilized world is all the more pleasurable by comparison.
So you descend into the regions of commercial
competition; the waste regions and desert lands of speculation;
the world where old men and women are left to die
in poverty after a life of usefulness; where little children,
innocent of wrong, are trained daily to sin, or are starved
to death in sight of plenty. We were glad to return to Co-opolis
and take up our labors in a land where we could not
hope to acquire more of the world’s good than we could use,
but where we could be sure that we and ours would not be
compelled to try subsistence on less than we needed, and
where every human being was guaranteed “the inalienable
rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE UNITED STATES CONVEYS PUBLIC LAND TO THE STATES—THE CO-OPOLITAN ASSOCIATION RECLAIMS THE SNAKE RIVER VALLEY—A GREAT AND BENEFICENT ENTERPRISE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The year 1905 witnessed the inauguration of two important
enterprises in Idaho, each of which has contributed
immeasurably to the development of the Co-operative Commonwealth.
Both were proposed, superintended and owned
by the Co-opolitan Association. The first was the irrigation,
cultivation and settlement of the Snake River Valley.
This valley at that time was noted for its wonderful scenery,
its broad expanse of uncultivated and unoccupied land, and
the majestic river which swept swiftly through it. All
public lands belonging to the United States had, the year
before, been granted to the various states in which they
were situated, each state being required to pay two cents an
acre to the Federal government therefor. Some of the
states proceeded to pay at once and receive the patent for
the lands so granted, and to dispose of the same to settlers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among those which paid for their acquisitions promptly
was Idaho. But the money to pay, amounting to one million
three hundred and eighty-six thousand dollars, was advanced
to Idaho by the Co-opolitan Association. This advance,
let it be understood, was not a loan. The state government
could not borrow money. But the Co-opolitan
Association had become so powerful and exercised such entire
and absolute control over the state government that
when it advanced this amount it was well understood that
it was able to reimburse itself at will. The state now acquired
the public lands of the Federal government, but was
powerless to improve them. What should be done?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The Great Council had met during the first half of the
year, and its members were all Co-opolitans except eleven.
It realized that it would be open to severe criticism outside
of the state if it should grant the newly acquired lands to
the Co-opolitan Association, whether for a consideration or
gratuitously. It did not concern Idaho what the world beyond
its territory thought, except that we were all anxious
that mankind, for its own good, should not be misled as
to the benefits of co-operation. Before that session of the
Great Council was closed a petition, signed by more than
twenty per cent of the voters of the state, was submitted to
the Governor, on the recommendation of the Great Council
itself, asking that the simple question of whether the public
lands of the state should be granted in fee simple absolute
to the Co-opolitan Association on condition that the
Association improve the same, be submitted to popular vote
at the October election. Under our law it was the duty of
the Governor, if such petition was properly signed, to submit
the question proposed as a matter of course, and it was
done accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was not the first time the people had by petition
initiated legislation, but it was the most important question
thus far submitted. There was no doubt as to the result,
because the Co-opolitan Association embraced nearly all
the people of the state except something like fifty thousand
who were scattered along the boundaries of Montana and
Wyoming, being principally placer miners and cattle men.
Even among these there were many inclined to favor the
grant. But the question was very fully discussed. The
Daily Co-opolitan, under my charge, presented the arguments
on all sides. Every company in the Industrial Army
was required to attend at least three meetings before election
day, at which the question was debated by the ablest
debaters we could find, and on election day it is safe to say
that the voters who were ignorant of the merits of this question
were exceedingly few. The election resulted in a vote
of two hundred and sixteen thousand five hundred and
three for and seven thousand three hundred and twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>against the grant. The decision of the people thus registered
was the law of the state and was sufficient in itself to
pass the title in all this land to the Association, but the formality
of issuing the patent was enacted when the Great
Council met the following January.</p>

<p class='c008'>Great were the preparations the day after election for
the work of reclaiming the Snake River Valley. The Legislative
Council was in constant session arranging the details
of an industrial occupation of a new and broader domain.
The Engineering department had long before procured
complete surveys of all the public lands, and more
especially of this valley. A final survey had been made for
an extensive system of irrigation flumes, canals and ditches,
together with reservoirs for the collection and storage of
surface waters, as well as the waters diverted from the river.
Four thousand men were dispatched, under the charge of
the proper departments, to commence the work and make
excavations along the survey at such points as they could
work most conveniently, and when the freezing of the
ground in the latter part of November made further work
in that direction impracticable the army returned to Co-opolis
and the companies composing it were sent to their
several home cities and engaged in other employment.</p>

<p class='c008'>When springtime came—the spring of 1906—the work
upon the irrigating system of Snake River Valley was again
resumed with an increased force. It was prosecuted with
such vigor that when the snow began to fly again the whole
system was completed and constituted the most extensive
of the kind on the American continent. The result was that
one million acres of land as fertile as any in the world, not
excepting the valley of the Nile, were made available for use
for agricultural purposes and all of this was the property
of the Co-opolitan Association. The whole of this broad
area was now turned over to the Agricultural department.
The Transportation department was also instructed to extend
the Co-opolis Southern Electric Railroad the entire
length of the valley, and in two years from the time the first
work was done on the irrigating system that marvelous region
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>was changed from a wilderness into a productive and
beautiful garden.</p>

<p class='c008'>The history of the Snake River region since then has
been one of the most startling illustrations of the power of
co-operation and the quantity of literature devoted to the
description of the valley, its people, its productivity, its
cities, roads, system and methods in all the countries and
languages of the civilized world show how deep an impression
this magnificent product of co-operation has made.
But the wealth which this valley added each year to the
Co-opolitan Association enabled us to carry the industrial
war forward with a celerity not anticipated. The Agricultural
department now—1909—had under its control three
million five hundred thousand acres of land devoted to
agriculture, five hundred thousand acres devoted to fruit
and at least eight million devoted to grazing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Co-opolitan Association was and is the most successful
farmer in the world! No wonder! There stand
between it and the consumer no middleman and no manufacturer.
Its own labor manufactures most of its own farm
tools and machinery. It feeds, clothes and shelters its own
farm hands, and both produces and manufactures food
and clothing. All represent to it the cost of labor only.
The wheat produced cost the Association in 1909 only
about five cents per bushel to produce. This estimate is
based upon the cost of machinery imported from other
states and paid for with metallic money. But even this was
too high an estimate, because when a machine was once imported
our mechanics kept it in constant repair, while other
farmers using machinery are continually paying out money
to keep it in serviceable condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>We paid nothing but labor. Other farmers were compelled
to sell their wheat at the lowest cash price paid by
traders and speculators, who invariably received a large
profit. We obtained that profit ourselves. Other farmers
saw their wheat ground into flour and sold at a profit by the
manufacturer to the wholesale dealer, who again sold at a
profit to the retailer, and the retailer added a profit and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>sold to the farmer. We received all this profit. The only
cost to us of a barrel of flour was the cost of such machinery
as I have described and the cost of transportation.
The Brotherhood stores at that time sold all our surplus on
commission. At the time of writing this—1917—the cost
of producing a barrel of flour at the great Shoshone flour
mills is, of course, nothing, the farm machinery, mill machinery
and all devices used in connection with such manufacture
being manufactured by the Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>The facts which I have thus briefly stated must make it
apparent that we were, as early as 1909, and even before
that time, in a position which was entirely unassailable by
competitors who had not placed themselves on a similar
foundation. Our system was in a condition to challenge
the whole industrial world in a free and fair field. We
could and did undersell every business house in all Idaho
and the competitive system, unable to compete against us,
had fled from the state. Its case was hopeless. It had no
footing, and never could have. It recognized capital as
master and labor as its humble servant. Our system reversed
the order and recognized labor as master and capital
as its creature and its obedient servant. For this reason
labor came to us and capital without labor was powerless.
Already this condition in Idaho was affecting all adjoining
states. The Co-operative system was, after ten years of
honest trial, so strong, and so wondrously beautiful in its
strength, that, overleaping the bounds of the co-operative
state, it was infecting Oregon and Washington, and colonies
framed upon the model of the Co-opolitan Association
were pouring into those states. But of that I have
something to say in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>PUBLICATION OF MRS. BRADEN’S NOVEL—THE PROFITS OF THE ASSOCIATION AND REWARD OF THE AUTHOR—THE PUBLISHING DEPARTMENT EXTENDS ITS SPHERE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Messenger and Publishing department, as I have
previously stated, was under my especial charge. Up to the
time Miss Woodberry, now Mrs. Braden, had given permission
to have her novel submitted to a Co-opolitan committee,
and that committee had reported favorably upon the
proposition to publish it, I had conducted this department
upon the most conservative lines. I confess that, even then,
the vastness of the power of co-operative labor to overcome
all obstacles was not fully comprehended by me. I had as
yet but dimly recognized that the combined strength of
labor directed to the accomplishment of a definite purpose
was simply irresistible. Business in the competitive world
which involves the sale and delivery of large accumulations
of property, real or fictitious, is transacted upon a ridiculously
narrow financial basis, and must necessarily be conducted
with extreme caution. But where the fiction of
money is abolished and the intercourse among men rests
upon the basis of labor exchange, which is as broad as the
earth itself, and as fair as perfect justice, there need be no
fear of setting in motion every productive energy available.
Too much of what men need or ought to have can never
impoverish them.</p>

<p class='c008'>My wife’s novel was placed upon the market for sale in
due season. The Daily Co-opolitan announced its appearance
and contained an able and very flattering criticism of
it from the pen of Mr. Edmunds. The first was a cheap
edition of twenty thousand copies, and so great was the
pride of all Idaho in this first literary work in the line of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>fiction which could be considered distinctively Co-opolitan
that the entire edition was exhausted before any could be
shipped out of the state. This edition was sold for twenty
cents a copy in labor-credit checks or industrial orders or
money. But the demand was so great from the Brotherhood
all over the country for this novel that I was compelled to
have another edition of 100,000 copies struck off, and this
was gotten up with so much greater ornamentation and in
so much better style that I thought proper to have the price
fixed at fifty cents a copy. The book had been commented
upon favorably by all the newspapers and magazines of the
United States and England, and not only the Brotherhood
but the entire literary world was anxious to read it. The
time was especially favorable to render it exceedingly popular.
It was just beginning to dawn upon civilized humanity
that Idaho was producing marvels in co-operative industry,
and that a new civilization was born. “The West Parish”
was a masterly presentation of the Co-operator’s case
against the competitor and had a powerful effect in convicting
the latter, before the tribunal of Christian civilization,
of high crimes and misdemeanors. The second edition
was exhausted as swiftly, almost, as water sinks in sand.
Again I was called upon to supply the unsatisfied demand of
the American reader. Its high literary merit, the picture it
drew of Utopia realized, the remedy it pointed out from
the standard of an actual modern experience, the relief it
offered to millions of starving men and women made it the
sensation of the day. All classes read it. Even the conservative
business man who, twenty years before, had, rather
vainly, boasted that he had escaped reading “Looking Backward,”
quietly bought a copy of “The West Parish,”
and, after reading it, handed it, without comment, to his
neighbor.</p>

<p class='c008'>I now found that these two editions of the first publication
of my department, in the book line, had added
$40,000.00 in United States money to the accumulations of
my department, and this I turned over to the Legislative
Council, according to law. Again I printed an edition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>one million copies. This was prepared in much cheaper
style, and by advice of our Legislative Council, whose advice
I had asked, I placed this edition in every book store
and on every news stand in the United States at five cents
a copy. This I did because it was now apparent that it was
producing a great awakening among the people, and I desired,
or rather, I should say, we desired, that the poor who
had no means might also read. But we realized a profit
even at that price, and we knew no better way to destroy the
profit system than to take its profit.</p>

<p class='c008'>We fought the devil with fire, and had a theory that if
we could gain control of his fire we could extinguish it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The million edition of “The West Parish” was taken
rapidly by the class for which it was intended and the Publishing
department realized the sum of $30,000.00 from
that source after paying cost of transportation. I now
placed an edition upon the market for standard use consisting
of twenty thousand copies, finely illustrated and elegantly
printed and bound. This was sold at one dollar per
copy, although in the competitive system it would have
been difficult for the publisher to have sold that edition on
the market for three dollars a volume and to have realized a
profit.</p>

<p class='c008'>My wife’s fame, of course, was now world-wide.
Wherever the English language was read her name had
become a household word. Her novel had also been translated
into most of the languages of Europe and was working
its way throughout the countries which described themselves
as Christian, although more slowly than in England
and the United States. The Co-opolitan Association was
mindful of her incalculably great service to the cause of
co-operation which it regarded as its own and at the proper
time, without any department recommending it, the Legislative
Council considered the propriety of offering her a
reward which her work and her genius merited.</p>

<p class='c008'>What should it be? The mechanic who invented a labor-saving
device or machine, the artist whose painting had
displayed extraordinary merit, the sculptor whose genius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>had chiseled in marble some living thought, the self-sacrifice
of some hero in a moment of peril, all these merited
reward, and our Association had dealt and knew how to
deal with these.</p>

<p class='c008'>But here the work had not been of moment so much because
of its allurement of wealth as its supreme value as an
educator. The Legislative Council considered that she was
entitled to five years’ release from duty as a member of the
Industrial Army, and so awarded. She was entitled to this
time at once and continuously, if she so notified her department
chief, Mr. Edmunds, or she could give notice that she
would take a portion of the time between certain dates. As
a matter of fact, she chose two years’ release and leave of
absence commencing January 1st, 1907, and the remainder
of her time later in her twenty-five years’ term of service.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having discovered the power which my department
could wield, not only in Idaho, but in the world, I determined
to exercise it to the fullest extent. Linotypes, electroplates
and all the devices for saving labor were unsparingly
employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>I determined to put a Co-opolitan edition of all standard
works of all spheres or departments, literary, scientific, religious
and political, on the American market in every great
city.</p>

<p class='c008'>I began with Shakespeare. I caused an elegant edition
of that immortal poet’s work to be gotten up in excellent
style, and sold for about two-thirds what it would cost any
other house in the United States to produce. I increased
my plant and followed the edition of Shakespeare in quick
succession and at similarly reduced prices, with editions of
all the standard English authors.</p>

<p class='c008'>In three years’ time I had Co-opolitan book stores established
in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
Washington, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, St.
Paul, Minneapolis, Omaha, Atlanta, New Orleans, Galveston,
Denver, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. The
competitive publishing houses could not compete with our
system and house after house fell before us or limited their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>business. I also established correspondents all through the
world and had the latest news sent to the Co-opolitan newspaper.</p>

<p class='c008'>My arrangements were such, in conjunction with the
Brotherhood and Co-operative stores now springing up
everywhere, that I had a Daily Co-opolitan issued in every
one of the cities named, and the news was flashed to them
daily, as it was to Co-opolis. I endeavored to have each
Daily Co-opolitan in the hands of the national Brotherhood
and each was issued on the plan of the great daily
which was sent from Co-opolis to all parts of Idaho. The
national Brotherhood was daily increasing in numbers and
power.</p>

<p class='c008'>My idea in extending branches of my department was to
aid the national organization in destroying competition.
How well I have succeeded the years have proved. The
publications of the Co-opolitan Association have displaced
all others and have brought millions to the safe in the basement
of the Council Hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>My department was divided in 1910 and I was confined
to one portion called the Publishing department. A new
department, including the messenger, telegraph, telephone
and postal service, was created and Jarvis Richardson was
elected its chief. I would be glad to comment upon the
glorious administration of that new department, by that
great and good man, but the scope of my present work does
not permit. Necessarily in such a work as this I can but
give the reader the most salient features of my own personal
experience which tend to throw light upon the development
of Idaho under the Co-opolitan control.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE STRANGER FROM LONDON—BOISE CITY BONDS AND A LOAN—THE PERIL OF IDAHO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The year 1906 should be considered one of the most
memorable in the history of Co-operation, more on account
of the great peril in which our system was placed than on
account of any extraordinary undertaking. Yet perhaps I
ought not to say that the year was devoid of important undertakings
either, inasmuch as the Co-opolitan Transcontinental
Railroad was conceived and planned that year. It
was in connection with this enterprise that our peril was
unwittingly incurred. The large accumulations of money
which our Association was constantly making had become
known to the world, so that if our Legislative Council entered
upon the consideration of any great proposition the
decision was looked for in financial circles, both in Wall
Street, New York, and Lombard Street, London, as being
a matter of prime importance. Co-opolis was now a formidable
opponent and rival of those celebrated centers of competitive
iniquity. Its methods were, however, the exact
opposite of those of Wall Street and Lombard Street.</p>

<p class='c008'>The proposition to construct a transcontinental railroad
was particularly interesting. It was the plan of Mr. Seabury,
chief of the Transportation department, to build the
road in question from Co-opolis to Chicago by what he declared
to be the only route which extended all the way
through a productive country. This route was to parallel
the Union Pacific to the Great Shoshone Falls, thence to
Idaho Falls, thence veering slightly in a northerly direction
to pass through the coal, iron, oil and cattle fields of
Wyoming, thence entering the Black Hills region near the
center, to proceed across the limestone foundation of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>wonderful country, down Rapid Valley to Rapid City, across
the divide to Box Elder Valley, down that fertile valley to
the Cheyenne River, down Bad River to the Missouri, over
the Missouri, and thence through South Dakota, Southern
Minnesota and Wisconsin to Chicago. It was also proposed
that this road should be extended to Seattle, on Puget
Sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plan was considered sufficiently practicable to warrant
the Legislative Council to instruct the Engineering
department to run preliminary surveys along the proposed
route as far as the Missouri River. This order was given in
the early spring; I think the records will show that it was
about April 10th. A month later there appeared at the Co-opolitan
Hotel an elderly gentleman who registered as Lester
Hickman, London, England. Mr. Hickman appeared
to be merely an English tourist. He did not, at first, make
special efforts to get acquainted, but neither did he display
any aversion to talking with other guests or citizens who
might come in his vicinity. There was nothing about him
to particularly attract attention, except that his face was
very pale, his hair white, and his eyes were very gray.
Perhaps they would have been very white, too, if that had
been possible for keen, observing eyes. Mr. Hickman’s
clothes fitted him perfectly and his style of dress indicated
the neat and modest gentleman. He looked the picture
of scholarly innocence and spotless purity. In passing
through the hotel I had noticed him several times during
the week, and I had seen him on the street several times,
but never felt any special curiosity as to who he might be.
One day I was in my office when the young man who acted
as my messenger and office attendant handed me a card,
upon which was the name Lester Hickman. The attendant
said the gentleman was in the anteroom and would be glad
to speak with me if I was at leisure. I was at leisure and
told him to show the gentleman in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good afternoon, sir,” said the old gentleman as he entered
the door, smiling and bowing good-naturedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had the air of a man whose business could not be very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>weighty, but whose motives were invariably humane. He
was as white as an angel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good afternoon,” I returned. “Your name, I see, is
Mr. Lester Hickman. I have noticed you several times
about the city. What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do not let me disturb you, sir.” Mr. Hickman looked
as if he could become my most intimate friend in five minutes,
as he smiled patronizingly and held his hand out
toward me with a gesture which seemed to indicate that he
was a great man at leisure and that I was a great man whose
time might be occupied. The whole manner of the man
flattered me and I felt that he had my confidence at once.
“I only called for information,” continued he, “and do
not wish to take your time, which I know is valuable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am at your service, Mr. Hickman,” said I. “Will you
be seated?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Hickman sat down. Even that he did with such
graceful, unassuming dignity, and with such exalted deference
to me, that I felt flattered again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have a wonderful city, Mr. Braden,” he exclaimed.
“Your people have certainly built up a wonderful
Commonwealth.” He looked at me as he said this, as
if he attributed the wonders he had seen to me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” I replied. “The Co-opolitan has reason to be
proud of his city. We have performed what has never before
been achieved in nine years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very true!” assented my visitor. “But you should have
added, Mr. Braden, that no people ever did as much in all
time.” Here he smiled, and I had an undefinable feeling
that he rather considered it would not have been done by
the Co-opolitan Association, even, if I had not been a
part of it. I found myself warming toward this sprightly,
perfectly straight, white little old man wonderfully. He
was either the most innocent, interesting and lovable or
the most artful and cunning of men. I was inclined to
think the former, but experience had taught me that such
men would bear study.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am anxious, Mr. Braden,” said Mr. Hickman, “to investigate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>your system of co-operation with a view to establishing
a similar system in England. Some of us have a
plan on foot to aid our impoverished and idle classes to gain
a foothold on earth and I have been sent by my association
to study Idaho. It occurred to me that you could aid me
in obtaining the information I desire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I certainly could not refuse so innocent a request, and I
and my people always hastened to extend aid to such an
enterprise as he described whenever it was proposed. I
assured the gentleman that I would place my department
at his disposal and recommended him to see Mr. Edmunds
of the Educational department. The latter would place
our historical records at his disposal and he would gain,
from that source, the fullest information.</p>

<p class='c008'>This white gentleman remained with me nearly an hour.
A more entertaining conversationalist it has rarely been
my fortune to meet. He had traveled extensively, was acquainted
with most of the famous men of England, and the
moral tone of his conversation was the highest conceivable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is only one thing I notice about your system
which I cannot approve,” said he. “Your Association has
pursued a course calculated to destroy the value of all the
public bonds in Idaho except those of the state. There are
Boise City municipal bonds, for instance, which have no
value in the market because you have constructed a magnificent
co-operative city outside the territory affected by
them. I do not see how you can escape the charge of immorality
in refusing to pay them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These remarks were made by the white saint with such
apparent sincerity that I did not at that time doubt they
sprang from an honest heart. I met him many times after
and he never referred to that subject again. He remained
in Co-opolis three months, during which time he was a
constant attendant upon church and I observed that he was
often to be seen in the company of the members of the ministry.
Just before he departed he called upon the Legislative
Council, then in session, and asked to make a statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>to that body. The request was granted and he spoke
briefly. He said he understood that the Legislative Council
was considering plans for the construction of a transcontinental
railroad, that he understood the Association was not
then prepared to build the road, but would be obliged to
defer the completion of it until its finances permitted; that
he was acquainted with numerous philanthropic gentlemen
in England who were much interested in Co-opolitan success;
that he was able to procure from these gentlemen a
loan of one million pounds sterling for the Association, at
the nominal rate of three per cent interest per annum, the
bonds to run for twenty years; that he would use his best
endeavors to accomplish this purpose, providing the Association
would agree to purchase at the end of that time the
outstanding municipal bonds of the various cities for fifty
cents on the dollar. He said he had no knowledge as to who
might be the owners of such bonds, but for the good name
of the Association he desired to urge that this course be
pursued.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Legislative Council paid very little attention to this
proposal, at that time, ascribing it to the gentleman’s ignorance
of our system.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Hickman had not been gone a week before I made a
discovery which startled me. I found that a petition was
being circulated, under our Association law, asking the
President of the Association to submit three laws, which
were attached to the petition, to the people, to be voted
upon at the next October election. What appalled me most
was that they were being circulated by the clergy, who
went from house to house for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first provided that the Association borrow $5,000,000.00
for the purpose of constructing a transcontinental
railroad and issue bonds on such road bearing three per cent
interest per annum and running for twenty years. The
second recited the moral obligation of the Association to
assume certain municipal bonds which had become valueless
and to pay for the same, setting forth also the fact that
as long as these bonds remained unpaid the territory formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>occupied by the cities of Lewiston, Boise, Ketchem,
Shoshone and several others would be valueless. It then
provided that the Association pay for these bonds at the
rate of fifty cents on the dollar in five years from the
passage of the law. The third provided that all industrial
orders be retired and that all labor be paid for after January
1st, 1907, by labor checks which would be non-transferable.</p>

<p class='c008'>While these three laws were to be submitted separately
for the voters to pass upon, they were attached to one petition.
The law permitted this action at that time, but as
soon as possible after this abuse was discovered the Legislative
Council corrected the plain defect so that each law
must be supported by a separate petition in order to obtain
a reference to the people, and the correction was so obviously
proper that it has ever since remained the law.</p>

<p class='c008'>I made no doubt when I saw this petition that the white
saint-like personage, Lester Hickman, was an agent of some
English syndicate, and that this whole scheme had been set
on foot by him to get the municipal bonds of these several
cities paid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some time after I learned that I was correct in this surmise.
His syndicate had procured the bonds referred to
for a mere nominal sum, and hit upon the plan of loaning
the Association $5,000,000.00 and getting the bonds paid
at the same time. As for the proposed loan, it would have
been as safe as the bonds of the nation, and the entire
financial world so regarded it. Why not? The Co-opolitan
Association was absolutely solvent and was looked upon as
enormously rich.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hickman was a shrewd agent. He had amassed great
wealth for himself, and was as artful as any living man in
inducing men to part with the fruits of their industry without
receiving due compensation. In approaching the Co-opolitan
Association he donned the sheep’s clothing of an
adviser and advocate of co-operation, and went immediately
to the ministry and preached morality. With them
he succeeded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who best understood the theory of morals and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>could preach it in all its purity were least able to discriminate
between the spurious and the real. Hickman belonged
to a class of artful tempters who have done more to
enslave mankind and degrade morals than any other. Members
of this class go forth daily from our great cities to
lobby in legislative bodies, bribe judges, corrupt city councils
and induce the representatives of the people to give
away valuable public privileges or part with public utilities.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Co-opolis Hickman enlisted the clergy by making
large donations to the churches, talking to them about a
high standard of morality which he professed, claiming to
be entirely disinterested and assuming a modest and retiring
piety. He was a financial Talleyrand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The result of Hickman’s efforts was that after he was
gone, and almost before we knew what was going on, the
petition containing thirty thousand names of members
of the Association was sent to the President. This was
not twenty per cent of the population of the state, but at
that time all Co-operators were not members of the Co-opolitan
Association. There were several distinct associations,
embracing in their membership a total of nearly
forty thousand. There were, besides, some thirty thousand
who were not members of any association. Three years
later all co-operative associations in the state were received
into the Co-opolitan Association, and the individualists
who still declined to become identified with our organization
were few. But at the time the petitions in question
were presented the thirty thousand names affixed to them
constituted twenty per cent of the total vote of the Co-opolitan
Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here then issue was joined. However impatient our
chief officers might feel with the Co-operators who had imprudently
and unwisely raised these serious questions, or at
least the bond and credit questions, there was no alternative
and the duty to refer them to the popular vote was imperative.
Some of us felt that it was a great misfortune,
and I confess that I trembled for the result. Let me say
now, as a candid man, that I have never been very sanguine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of the success of any issue which was left to the popular
decision, except on the one occasion when I felt faith in the
successful establishment of the co-operative programme in
1902.</p>

<p class='c008'>My faith even then rested upon a theory that the masses
will sometimes do right impulsively and err when they stop
to deliberate. As a candid man, I am also bound to say that
experience proves my suspicions to have been unfounded in
every instance. Our referendum law was, and is, in one
respect, superior to that of Switzerland. It provided then,
as now, that proposed laws should be published for a period
of six weeks at least, but, in addition, it very wisely denied
to any member the right to vote unless he had attended
three public debates in which the law to be voted on was
discussed. Our method then, as now, was to appoint certain
days for such discussions, and we selected the ablest
disputants on both sides of the question at issue to fully
present the arguments on their respective sides in joint debate.
In this manner the people became fully informed.
These disputants were generally recommended then, as
now, by the partisans of one or the other theory, but if no
recommendation was made the Association appointed an
able and learned man to represent the defaulting side.</p>

<p class='c008'>No political party has ever existed in Idaho since 1905.
Men have combined on numerous occasions the better to
support their convictions with regard to certain proposed
laws; but the men who honestly agreed on one proposition
were just as likely to honestly disagree as to the next question.
So that each organization was at an end when its
mission was accomplished. Moreover, as all are provided
for, there is no occasion to form parties to secure political
office.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE DEBATE ON THE BOND AND CREDIT LAWS—REV. CADMUS M. DESTY AND THE MORAL LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The discussion of the bond and credit laws referred to
the people to be voted upon at the Association election in
October, 1907, was as earnest, interesting and thorough as
any which had ever occurred in Idaho. The advocates of
their adoption were vigorous and persistent and regarded
themselves as conscientious.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were not honest, however, with themselves. They
had allowed an artful and unscrupulous agent of the competitive
system to convince them that a moral question was
involved and to delude them into believing him to be a
great and good man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed, Hickman had written a pamphlet on “Co-operation
and Financial Integrity,” which was published on his
return to New York City from Co-opolis, and a large number
of these had been sent back to Co-opolis and distributed
throughout Idaho.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was an able presentation of the view he desired his
partisans in Idaho to urge. It was not his view, however,
but simply the plea which a shrewd lawyer in the competitive
world might make for a guilty criminal. It was sufficiently
effective to become the text-book of the affirmative
in the discussion, and they lauded Hickman to the skies
until it was proven that he had for years been the trusted
agent of the celebrated banking house of Rothschild. After
that the bond advocate mentioned Hickman no more.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this discussion every member of the Legislative Council
of the Association and every member of the Great Council
were listed in opposition to these laws. Ex-Governor,
now United States Senator, Thompson was one of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>active of the negative speakers. On the side of the affirmative
was the Reverend Dr. Cadmus M. Desty, the famous
pulpit orator, a most conscientious man and an intelligent
Co-operator. He had become convinced, and I would stake
life itself that he was perfectly honest in the matter, that
our whole system must fail if we broke what he conceived
to be God’s law, and did what was unjust and dishonest.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole basis of his contention was the moral law.
He was an emotional speaker. It was his custom to support
his views by making copious quotations from the bible and,
drawing from them some conclusions which were satisfactory
to his mind, launch into an exhortation which was perfectly
irresistible to some of his emotional followers.</p>

<p class='c008'>In those days our discussions were not conducted as they
are to-day. Then the disputants were given an hour or an
hour and a half each to present his side. Our system of
requiring the affirmative to state an argument in ten minutes,
and the negative to reply in the same length of time,
continuing in this manner for several hours in the presence
of referees who permit no divergence from the subject, is
calculated to exclude oratory and passion, and raise the discussion
to an intellectual plane. But the system was not
adopted until 1912.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be confessed that the oratorical contests of the
old style were as interesting as a circus or gladiatorial show,
in which respect they were superior to the give-and-take
method of to-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greatest of all the debates of that campaign occurred
between Senator Thompson and the Reverend Dr. Desty
during September. One of these took place in the great hall
at Co-opolis. There were present 9,000 members of the
Industrial Army and one thousand pupils from the schools.
It was our custom to have the Educational department send
a certain number of its wards to these discussions, in order
to have them familiarized with Co-opolitan methods. These
questions were always discussed fully in the schools as well
as in the Industrial Army.</p>

<p class='c008'>The discussion in the great hall was opened by Dr. Desty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>He insisted that the bonds of Boise City should be paid, that
the poor people, who doubtless held them, factory operators
in the unfortunate competitive cities, perhaps, had purchased
them in good faith; that the action of the Co-opolitan
Association, which he entirely approved, had rendered
these bonds valueless, and that the Association, which was
founded on principles of justice, equality and righteousness,
should not withhold from these poor people what belonged
to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>He also pointed out the fact that as long as the bonds
remained outstanding the territory affected by them would
be lost to the Association. Then came the wonderful, soul-stirring
oratory of the man, which moved his hearers to the
depths. I almost felt, as I listened to him on that occasion,
that perhaps he was right.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he finished the applause from all parts of the
hall was deafening. I believe now that it was more an
acknowledgment of his wonderful oratory than because he
had produced a conviction of the correctness of his views,
but I was distressed by different thoughts then.</p>

<p class='c008'>Senator Thompson followed on behalf of the negative.
The Senator was at that time in the very prime of an exceptionally
strong and vigorous manhood. He had occupied
the important positions of President of the Association
and Governor of the state, the former for seven years, the
latter for two. His reputation was world-wide, not as an
orator, but as the father of the Co-operative Commonwealth
and the possessor of extraordinary administrative ability.
He had not, as yet, taken his oath of Senator of the United
States, having been but recently elected, and was hardly
known as a public speaker outside of the state. He was not
an emotional orator.</p>

<p class='c008'>His chief characteristics in debate were his ready wit, his
complete command of the subject under discussion, and his
logical and powerful array of facts. He was the opposite
of the Reverend Dr. Desty in nearly every respect. That
day he was at his best. As he came forward to the speakers’
stand he was received with terrific applause. This was always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the case, however, and it did not indicate that his was
the most popular side.</p>

<p class='c008'>He commenced by informing the audience that he did
not desire to use any personal influence with them concerning
the exercise of their suffrage. He wished them to be
guided by truth and wisdom only. If the people of Idaho
were not sufficiently intelligent to save their Co-operative
Commonwealth then it must fall, because their intelligence
was its sole foundation. He had some evidence to present
for their consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here he read three affidavits from England, which set
forth the business, character and history of one Lester
Hickman. These averred that gentleman to be the president
of the American and English Bond and Trust Company,
limited, of London, and that his company was the purchaser,
for a mere nominal sum, of the municipal bonds
of the cities of Idaho. They further averred that Hickman
was known as a bitter enemy of all movements for the bettering
of the condition of the people, and neither more nor
less than a keen broker and speculator. They also set forth
that Hickman’s reputation for honesty was somewhat
shady.</p>

<p class='c008'>After reading these affidavits Senator Thompson exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is the prophet of financial morality whose teachings
are invoked for your instruction by my good and sincere
but misguided friend, Dr. Desty.” At this point the
applause which shook the house and was again and again
repeated marked the turning of the tide of public sentiment
against the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think now,” resumed the Senator, after quiet was restored,
“that the bond and credit laws are dead. But I
would not have you decide this question on the simple fact
that the man who instigated them is a selfish hypocrite and
schemer. I want you to understand these laws thoroughly
and adopt or reject them on their merits. If they are good,
it matters not who proposes them. Let them be adopted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>If they are bad, it matters not what demon inspired them,
they should be rejected.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These laws are for what purpose? To introduce among
you the most iniquitous feature of the competitive system.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Once allow it to be introduced, whether under the guise
of necessity or morality, whether by Shylock or by an erring
angel, and I would not give a straw for your entire
system. It will eat its way into the very heart of your body
politic and destroy all that is worth having about it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“History shows to my mind successive systems of slavery,
one chasing the other through the earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bond slavery succeeded chattel slavery and has nearly
crushed liberty to death in the great republic. There is
not the slightest reason why the Co-opolitan Association
should become indebted to private persons.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are the public, the law, the will of Idaho, and what
we desire within the state that we can have. If we wish to
build a railroad beyond the state we ought to have no difficulty
in doing that.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is necessary to such a road? First you must have
the line surveyed. That has been done. Next you must
have the right of way. That will be somewhat expensive.
But if the right of way costs us five million dollars why
should we borrow it? We have it already. Even if we did
not have it, let me remind you that from 1862 to 1892, a
period of thirty years, Idaho produced nearly two hundred
million dollars of gold and silver, and her producing population
was at no time greater than thirty thousand persons.
With a population such as we have to-day we can produce
gold enough, if gold is needed, in a single year, to build
this road.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would not Idaho be demented to borrow gold from a
hypocritical agent of Rothschild when we can, without incurring
debt, take it from our own valleys, creek beds and
mountains?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Senator treated the question of bond issues from
every point of view conceivable, with a power of description,
illustration and argument that not only held his audience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>spellbound, but fixed its logic deep in the minds of all
who heard him. Such was the effect of the affidavits which
he read upon the mind of his reverend opponent that the
latter declared his intention never again to enter upon the
discussion of political questions or questions of public
finance. Thenceforth he confined himself to religion and
became a world-renowned pulpit orator.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the election occurred the vote was overwhelming
against all these laws, the last going down largely on account
of the unpopularity of the two others known as the
land and credit propositions. Our system did not permit
the submission of a rejected law for at least five years after
its rejection. The proposition to abolish the labor orders
and pay all labor in non-transferable checks was a really
meritorious one and ought to have been adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The people, however, are so constituted that once their
suspicions are aroused they are much readier to say no than
yes, and the abolition of orders as a medium of labor exchange
had to wait until 1912. It is gratifying, however, to
be able to say that the people were less and less inclined to
demand such orders, and more and more inclined to receive
the labor checks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The defeat of the bond and credit laws had the effect of
placing the Co-opolitan Association and the co-operative
system on an enduring basis. The entire world now realized
that it was an assured and successful system and in
every state in the Union the tendency was toward the enactment
of laws favorable to co-operative action on the part
of the laborer. Nearly all the states, seized by the spirit of
the hour, began to discuss the propriety of calling a constitutional
convention and reforming their systems of state
government upon the model of Idaho.</p>

<p class='c008'>The features of our state constitution most favored were
its provisions embodying the initiative and referendum
and the imperative mandate, which I have already described.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='large'>WHY IDAHO HAS A DUAL GOVERNMENT—A GLIMPSE AT THE LAW.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The second Governor of Idaho and the second President
of the Co-opolitan Association, succeeding Senator Thompson
to both positions, was Hon. Henry B. Henderson. The
political machinery of the state was in the control of the
Association and our policy was to make the executive officers
of the Association the executive officers of the state
also. Some of those readers who live beyond the boundaries
of Idaho into whose hands this history may come
do not comprehend why we continued to run two organizations
in the name of the people, instead of one. They are,
perhaps, at a loss to understand why the Co-opolitan Association
did not, when it had acquired nearly all the land in
Idaho and embraced nearly all the population of the state,
transfer its dominion to the state government and operate
its co-operative system as a state institution. The reason
is simple enough. The state was necessarily limited in its
powers by the Federal constitution. There were several
very important functions which were by that instrument
denied to state governments, but not to private corporations,
and we desired to exercise them.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have already adverted to the fact that the Federal constitution
prohibits the state from issuing “bills of credit.”
This does not prevent corporations, associations or private
persons from doing so. When we dealt with the commercial
world “bills of credit” were often necessary. Moreover,
our industrial orders might be construed to be bills of
credit and this plan of labor exchange was, in reality, one
of the most important features of our co-operative system.
If the state had inaugurated such a plan the Federal prohibition
would have crushed it at once.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Still another important power would have been lost had
the state government owned and operated our system. We
could not have extended our business into any other state
in the Union. It was our purpose to build railroads. Most
of the states permitted a corporation organized in another
state for that purpose to build railroads within their limits
and take land for their right of way by right of eminent domain.
No state had a law upon its statute books which
gave similar powers to another state. It had never been
contemplated that a state would do business or own railroads
within its own limits, much less within the limits of
another state.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Co-opolitan Association was organized under the
laws of Idaho. There the Association did not so much conform
to the laws as the laws conformed to the needs of the
Association. This dual system proved to be extremely useful.
We made the state perform police duties for us and
regulate the relation of our members to one another. We
had a system of courts regulated by state law, but these had
little to do. In 1910 we repealed the laws giving remedies
for the collection of any debt or the enforcement of any
contract entered into after January 1st, 1911, except
against the Co-opolitan Association. We had a criminal
code and punished crimes, but the people were all provided
for and educated, so that three great causes of crime—poverty,
excessive wealth and ignorance—being minimized,
the criminal courts had little to do. That other cause of
crimes—drunkenness—is uncommon. All alcoholic or intoxicating
drinks were not only sold by the Association, but
were of the purest quality. It was and is a crime to import
any liquors into the state for sale, but the Association is its
own manufacturer.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the labor of the state of Idaho was, as early as 1910,
performed exclusively by the Industrial Army of the Co-opolitan
Association. We had intended at the outset of
our career to transfer all our property to the state government
when it should come under our control, but for the
reasons already mentioned that plan was abandoned. Even
as late as the year following the adoption of our Co-operative
institution we expected to pursue that course. But as
soon as we began the actual work of legislation we discovered
that the better and simpler method, and one which
rendered it easier to avoid conflict with the Federal constitution,
was to keep the state government within very
narrow limits. As a result the state government delegated
all its important functions which could be delegated to the
Co-opolitan Association. Its Great Council still continued
to exercise its legislative and judicial functions and the
executive still continued to act as the chief police and military
officer. But the state government was hardly more
than a bridge connecting the Co-operative state with the
Federal Constitution. The latter could not recognize the
former, but the state government could, and did. The
state complied with the constitution of the country as a
political organism. The Co-opolitan Association, as the
industrial, financial, social and commercial organism, did
as it pleased. Notwithstanding all this, the Co-operative
state, the state of Idaho and the Co-opolitan Association
were one and the same, and the last-mentioned, embracing
all the people of the state and its membership, was the living
and controlling power in and behind the whole.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>We had expected that the state of Idaho would have an
Industrial Army of its own. Experience, however, convinced
us that it would be far better to do all its work
through the Association. Insane, weak-minded, blind,
sick, aged and infirm persons who were members of the
Association were cared for by the Association, so that the
state had no duty to perform toward them. The children
of our members inherited membership, losing it only by violating
its laws in some few particulars, so that insane, weak-minded,
sick or infirm children of members were all cared
for. To care for persons who might be afflicted, however,
and were not members of the Association was the state’s
concern. To punish criminals was its duty. The Great
Council contracted with the Co-opolitan Association to care
for its afflicted and its criminals, and the sole consideration
which it charged for this burden was that it have the benefit
of the labor of the able-bodied among them.</p>

<p class='c008'>We soon found that the criminals whom the state consigned
to our care, when given a fair opportunity, were
most of them able and willing to work. This was all the
more apparent when we offered a reward, consisting of
wages equal to a Co-opolitan’s dividend, for meritorious
conduct. We rarely ever permitted a convict to become a
member of our Industrial Army, however meritorious his
work, but we did not oblige him to quit our service on the
penitential farm or in the penitential factories when his
term of service expired. Yet we did admit Barnstead, who
invented a flying machine; Applegate, the inventor of the
electric plough; Turner, that poet who sang with wonderful
power the songs of Remorse, Injustice and Sorrow, and
some thirty others. The state criminal is now almost a
thing of the past, yet fifteen years ago our penitential farms
and factories were important concerns. But we made them
pay. They produced not only enough wealth to support
themselves substantially, but enough to support the state
insane, weak-minded, sick, aged and infirm, whose several
asylums adjoined the farms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our Industrial Army in that year—1910—contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>twenty-four departments, in which 1,025,525 persons were
at that time enlisted. Of these four hundred and sixty-two
thousand one hundred and twenty-one were women.
It was a magnificent body of well-trained, intelligent, earnest,
industrious and faithful men and women. The chief
of this body was the President of the Association. Its
movements were directed by the Legislative Council. Its
general laws were enacted by that body, but each department
and subdivision had regulations of its own which did
not conflict with those provided by the Legislative Council.
There were then twenty-five general departments, as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>1st. Department of Agriculture. All occupations requiring
the cultivation of the soil, except such as were within
the Nursery and Fruit department, were within its province.</p>

<p class='c008'>2nd. The Live Stock department had charge of all cattle,
horses, sheep, hogs and other animals, as well as birds.</p>

<p class='c008'>3rd. The Nursery and Fruit department had charge of
all orchards, vines and plants bearing fruit and all horticultural
plants and flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>4th. The Irrigation department had charge of all waters
and the distribution of the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>5th. The Commerce department had charge of all department
stores and was charged, as now, with supplying
the needs of the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>6th. The Manufacturing department had charge of all
factories and all manufactures.</p>

<p class='c008'>7th. The Transportation department had charge of all
highways, methods of transportation, vehicles and the operation
of the same.</p>

<p class='c008'>8th. The Messenger and Publishing department had
charge of the means and instrumentalities of communication
and publication, including telegraphs, telephones, signals,
newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p class='c008'>9th. The Educational department had charge of the education
of the young.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>10th. The Department of Public Amusements had
charge of the entertainment of the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>11th. The Department of Health had charge of the public
health, the care, treatment and cure of the sick and the
burial of the dead. Also all hospitals, sanitariums, mineral
springs, medicines, drugs and medical practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>12th. The Legal department had charge of the legal
business of the Association. This department employed
about one hundred and fifty persons in 1910.</p>

<p class='c008'>13th. The Timber and Forestry department had charge
of the timber and saw mills of the Association. It was also
charged with the preservation of the forest.</p>

<p class='c008'>14th. The Labor department had charge of the unclassified
labor of the Association. From the Educational
department all students passed into this department, where
they were generally required to serve three years. All persons
enlisting who did not possess a trade or evince some
special aptitude were also generally assigned to this department.
Advancement to other departments, or the official
positions in this one, were the rewards of merit. This department
was also required to find constant employment for
its forces or to report forthwith to the Legislative Council
its failure to do so. In the latter case the Legislative Council
would cause new enterprises to be undertaken.</p>

<p class='c008'>15th. The Department of Public Improvements was
charged with the investigation of all plans for new roads,
parks, waterways and the improvements of the methods,
conveniences and comforts of the people. Plans or ideas
were received by this department from any person and
whenever a plan or idea was accepted, provided it was new,
original and meritorious, a reward in the form of a vacation
was given the originator.</p>

<p class='c008'>16th. The Department of Invention was charged with
the duty of searching out, investigating, testing and introducing
all labor-saving inventions to the Association.
This proved to be one of the most useful departments.
Manufacturers are not usually able to find time to experiment
and are generally averse to introducing new machinery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>or methods. This department did all the work of
experimenting and reported results.</p>

<p class='c008'>17th. The Department of Art had charge of all decorating,
painting, drawing, sculpture, architecture, designing,
etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>18th. The Engineering department had charge of all
engineering work.</p>

<p class='c008'>19th. The Department of Building not only had charge
of all buildings, and was responsible for their healthfulness
and security, but was the manufacturer of all building material,
except lumber, and quarried all stone employed by
it or shipped to another state. The granite, white calico
and lilac mottled marble, the gypsum, sandstone and other
building stone, as well as ornamental onyx stone, produced
by our quarries, were, and still are, handled by this department.</p>

<p class='c008'>20th. The Department of Mining had charge of all the
mining except coal.</p>

<p class='c008'>21st. The Land department had charge of all the unused
lands of the Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>22d. The Food department had charge of the preparation
and distribution of all foods at public or private tables,
the killing, dressing and packing or canning of meats, and
the preparation, preserving or canning of fruits, vegetables
and other edibles.</p>

<p class='c008'>23d. The Department of Fuel, Heat and Light had
charge of all heating and lighting plants and all sources of
fuel, such as coal mines, gas wells and oil wells.</p>

<p class='c008'>24th. The Department of Science had charge of the
scientific investigation, of the geology, mineralogy and
natural resources of the state and their chemical analysis.</p>

<p class='c008'>25th. The Department of Accounts and Statistics was
then, as now, the Auditory department. In addition to
this it received and transmitted all orders between the departments.
For instance, if the flour section of the department
store desired flour the Commerce department must
send its orders to the Department of Accounts and Statistics.
Here the order is recorded and immediately transmitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>to the Manufacturing department. If the Manufacturing
department has no flour it transmits an order to this
department for wheat, which is recorded and transmitted
to the Agricultural department. When the order for wheat
is filled this department is notified by the department filling
and that receiving, and so with the flour when delivered.
This department also keeps a full record of all the property
and products of the Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>These several departments were again subdivided by the
Legislative Council into divisions and sections.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our method of co-operation, through the instrumentality
of the Industrial Army, resulted in our being able to produce
more than three times as much wealth each year as an
equal population usually did in the competitive system.</p>

<p class='c008'>The population of the state at that time, including men,
women and children, was 3,160,000. Such a population in
a competitive state will contain about five thousand lawyers.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had one hundred and fifty lawyers and four thousand
eight hundred and fifty strong men in our producing ranks.
The wives of these men were also in our Industrial Army.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such a population in competition usually supports six
thousand saloon men and bartenders. Liquors were sold in
the various department stores of the Association at that
time and in the restaurants and hotels, but there were no
bars and no saloons. They were handled incidentally with
drugs, medicines or foods. In the competitive system the
liquor dealers and bartenders form a special force. The
liquors in Idaho were dispensed by the clerks and waiters
who handled other goods. We could safely count six thousand
workers in our Industrial Army aiding in the production
of wealth instead of six thousand saloon men and bartenders.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of eight thousand claim, commission, real estate
and insurance agents and collectors we had an equal number
of men at work in our factories, on our farms, or in the
distributing departments.</p>

<p class='c008'>The restaurant and hotel keepers, brokers, commercial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>travelers, hucksters and peddlers and merchants in such a
population in a competitive state would number sixty thousand.
All these, instead of preying upon us and consuming
the fruits of our labor without giving any return for it,
were now at work with us.</p>

<p class='c008'>Body and personal servants who wait upon the rich in a
state of three million inhabitants will number in the neighborhood
of ninety thousand, and all these were in our Industrial
Army helping to increase the annual wealth of the
state.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had no gamblers, professional capitalists, speculators
or leisure classes in 1910, but we had an equal number of
honest workers.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were not compelled to waste time in searching for employment,
hunting for customers or waiting for trade.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were not distressed by the pressure of a few overburdened
and a large number who could get neither the
burden nor the reward for carrying it.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were no overdone trades and no overstocked markets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wherever we found power, whether human, natural or
mechanical, we sought to employ it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two incentives were furnished by the Association to honest
and diligent effort on the part of the worker. The first
was promotion to a higher grade. The second was a reward
in the nature of a leave of absence. These incentives were
powerful, especially as Idaho, being one of the most beautiful
and picturesque states in the Union and abounding in
game, offered an inviting field for recreation. But another
force was also at work among the men and women of the
Army. Each felt that he was a partner in this great enterprise.
Each regarded the idler who “stole time” as his foe.
Each was determined that the other should do his duty, and
the laggard and loafer was regarded with such contempt
by his associates that no one cared to incur the odium of
that reputation. This had a very pronounced effect both as
to the quality and quantity of the work done.</p>

<p class='c008'>At and before that time I had noticed that a large number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of those who entered the Army from other states were
actuated by a desire to earn the large dividends paid to
members for several years, cash their checks or orders and
withdraw. In a few instances only have I noticed that
these intentions were carried out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such persons found that in our system they were able to
obtain all the best fruits of competition without the worry,
distress and mockery of that system. Their labor was better
rewarded, their hours of toil were shorter, they were
never confronted by want, they were called upon to divide
with neither poverty nor distress; they were equal to the
best as far as material things were concerned and they were
not superior to any one in those respects. I remember that
a few were, or affected to be, distressed because they could
not own any real estate. But in a few months they realized
that they would never be disturbed in the possession of the
house they occupied as long as it satisfied them, and that,
should sickness or death come, their families were safe.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a workman was injured or fell sick his dividend
was paid as fully as if he were at work. If injured by accident
or negligence he had no remedy, although the person
responsible for his injury might suffer punishment. His
assurance of receiving his membership dividends was sufficient
comfort.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the worker urged that he should have a vested right in
the Association property, above the share of its annual earnings,
it was only necessary to remind him that in the competitive
system he would never think of demanding of his
employer a similar share, and was generally compelled to be
satisfied with a pittance for wages. In the co-operative
system he received his dividend, which represented, in
1910, twelve hundred dollars per annum, purchased everything
he needed cheaper than competition ever made it for
him, was insured against accident or sickness, had his family
protected against his death, was furnished educational facilities
and positions for his children, and was more certainly
a part of the governing power than he could be under any
constitution. Instead of being the hunted victim of a hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>ingenious robbers who flattered him with the promise
that he would strengthen his individuality by permitting
them to chase and starve him and his family, he discovered
that his individuality improved with prosperity and his
confidence and courage rose in an equal and healthy contest.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Co-opolitan Transcontinental Railroad was completed
in 1910 to Chicago. Two years before that the last
spike had been driven at Seattle, on Puget Sound, and
trains had since been running regularly on that portion of
the road. The construction of the road through Washington,
Wyoming and South Dakota was not interrupted by
any obstacles or opposition. Indeed, the people of those
states offered every inducement for us to pass through their
country.</p>

<p class='c008'>When we reached the Black Hills in South Dakota we
found the route from Silver City to Rapid City down the
narrow valley of Rapid Creek occupied by a partially completed
railroad which the projector had been compelled to
abandon for lack of funds. This we purchased for a small
sum. With that exception the right of way through Washington,
Wyoming and South Dakota cost us practically
nothing. Moreover, the farmers in Eastern South Dakota
aided us with their labor, accepting the produce and merchandise
which we brought with us from Idaho for pay.
The labor orders, also, were in demand along that part of
our road, and we established the department stores in the
states where these orders were soon received back for wares.</p>

<p class='c008'>The state of Washington was at the time our road reached
Seattle largely under the control of the Washington Co-operative
Association, and that Association, being like the
Co-opolitan, a creature of the National Brotherhood of the
Co-operative Commonwealth, deemed its interests identical
with ours and aided us materially in pushing our enterprise
in that direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois the several legislatures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>had denied to all, except domestic corporations, the
right to exercise the power of eminent domain. This law
had been passed at recent sessions of their legislatures at
the instance of certain railroad companies to exclude our
line. The people of these several states had been much
incensed when the laws mentioned were enacted. Had the
initiative and referendum been in force there as in Idaho
this would not have been a serious impediment. We could
then have gone among the indignant citizens and procured
a petition signed by twenty per cent of the voters of the
state asking that the obnoxious laws be submitted to the
popular vote.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such was the feeling against the corrupt corporations at
the time that people would have hastened to sign such a
petition. But they had no initiative and referendum law,
and so were at the mercy of the corruptionists.</p>

<p class='c008'>The plain reason why the competing railroads desired to
exclude our line, and why the farmers desired to have it
enter these states, was the understanding that we would
reduce all rates, both passenger and freight, to the great
advantage of the farmers.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fact, we designed to make a reduction in these respects
which would mean ruin for all competing lines.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were able to do this.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first place the road had cost us nothing but labor,
except what we paid in cash to purchase the Rapid Valley
Road and the right of way over the lands of certain hostile
farmers. Even this cash represented our labor and was
valuable only as it would purchase other labor or its
products.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the competitive roads had been enormously expensive
to build. The projectors were compelled, when
they proposed their enterprises, to bribe a large number of
so-called capitalists to advance money which had doubtless
been intrusted to them by laborers for investment. Such
capitalists, having little they could call their own, must
needs obtain it.</p>

<p class='c008'>So these railroad builders and their financiers placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>side by side with the genuine million won from labor a
false and pretended million which had its inception in and
owed its existence to fraud. Then the true and false were
made to pass together, with extended hands demanding of
the toiler a portion of his product as their lawful dues.
The one was just, the other a fiction and a sham.</p>

<p class='c008'>False stock, which never had any basis in labor; false
bonds, which had no mission except to defraud labor of its
product; false pretenses, which made it possible for knaves
to live by their wits, were the excuses which capitalists put
forth for those extortionate rates by which the people were
impoverished.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our railroad represented no such presumptuous and dastardly
pretensions. We came as labor should come to labor,
asking no more and no less than labor’s honest dues.</p>

<p class='c008'>No stock, no bonds, no fraudulent construction companies
came with us. We did not deal in dollars nor peddle
securities.</p>

<p class='c008'>We had naught but labor to expend, and pretended nothing
more. But we had all that labor makes and thousands
of willing hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>When we built our road we offered it for use as the
creature of labor and not the creature of capital.</p>

<p class='c008'>To build it and equip it we began at the very foundation.
The ore we mined, and smelted it in our own furnaces. We
fashioned our own plough and with it turned the furrow.
We made the harrow and followed it afield. We planted
the grain and when it ripened in the golden sun we harvested
it with blades our own hands wrought. We delved
again, and from the mines we brought the ore, and in the
blazing furnaces we moulded the steel automata which, at
our bidding, amid the Shoshone’s roar, reduced our wheat
to flour, or wove the wool of our own flocks to cloth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then we made rails of steel, and of the pulp of straw
made paper ties, and threw up grades, or hewed our way
through rock-ribbed hills. And so our road was built to
Minnesota’s line and we proposed to build it through that
state and onward to Chicago.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>It can be seen that our own road could, when completed,
be operated far cheaper than any of the competitive class.
We had our coal in Idaho at first cost; our iron at first cost;
our steel rails, ties and all necessary equipments at first
cost. No brokers or speculators intervened.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our railroad force wore clothing which we made, and no
retailer exacted from our employe a profit. We fed him
with our own home-grown and home-made flour, sugar,
beef and supplies. How could the competitors compete
with that?</p>

<p class='c008'>We did not delay long at Minnesota’s boundary. The
Brotherhood in that state soon organized a company under
the laws of the state and its stock was nearly all conveyed
to our Association, except just enough to enable us to have
nominal officers in the state as the law required. The same
course was pursued in Wisconsin and Illinois and our road
was completed in due time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Similar consequences followed the completion of this
road that followed the establishment of our department
store and hotel at Boise City.</p>

<p class='c008'>The business of nearly all the roads to the coast came to
the Co-opolitan. The other roads could not compete
with us.</p>

<p class='c008'>We reduced our rates to one cent a mile. The other roads
followed suit, supposing it possible for them to force us to
terms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Legislative Council thereupon placed the fare at one
dollar for the through trip from any point along the line to
Seattle and one cent per mile for any distance less than one
hundred miles. This was continued for two years without
any change and the travel on the road was enormous and
profitable at that price.</p>

<p class='c008'>Freight rates were also reduced. The result of this road
as to the manufactures of Idaho was to give them a “boom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Our woolen goods were especially salable. We had over
four million sheep in Idaho and our woolen mills were consuming
all the wool yield and that of Washington, Oregon
and Montana. These goods were of superior quality and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>we were able to sell them cheaper than English manufacturers
could without a tariff.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two years before our road was completed to Chicago,
after the last spike was driven at Seattle, we began the construction
in that city of three large buildings costing one
million dollars each.</p>

<p class='c008'>These were of the most magnificent character and were
equal to anything which in the competitive system would
have compelled us to spend four or five million each. The
reason was that we furnished the stone, slate, marble, lime
and all building material from Idaho and performed all the
work with our own Co-opolitan labor. We also transported
men and material on our railroad.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of these buildings was a co-operative store, another
a co-operative hotel and a third a Palace of Amusements.
This supplied Seattle with all needed in the way of clothing,
food, hotel entertainment or accommodation and
amusement or recreation, and constituted that combination
by which we had successfully defeated all industrial or
competitive opposition in Idaho.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Washington Co-operative Association had arranged
with us that we should be allowed Seattle as our seaport
town, and we proceeded to establish a steamship line with
China and Japan and arranged for other lines to countries
bordering on the Pacific Ocean. This we had no difficulty
in doing, as we had gold and silver in large quantities, taken
from our mines or won from competitors, with which to
deal with the barbarous people who use them.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for Seattle, it had long been inclined to co-operation.
Its business men and citizens had been for years struggling
against every conceivable disadvantage and were completely
at the mercy of trusts and combinations of the most
unconscionable character. They had been approaching
closer and closer to bankruptcy day by day until our “Three
Brothers,” as they called the hotel, department store and
amusement hall, received them into their fraternal arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since Seattle became a co-operative city it has grown to
be the great Pacific seaport of the co-operative world. Its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>widened avenues, its magnificent parks, its comfortable cottages,
its great wharves and piers, its forest of masts, its
magnificent Industrial Army, its schools and institutions
of learning all bespeak a prosperity which is the pride of
her citizens. And this pride is all the more excusable because
the Seattle of to-day is the property of all her citizens
and not the property of a few.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <span class='large'>CHARLIE WOODBERRY ASKS QUESTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We were seated on the veranda of my house on Salem
Avenue. It was a summer evening after tea in 1912. My
wife sat by my side and her brother, Charlie Woodberry, a
young man about twenty-two, sat with us. My little daughter
and a number of children about her own age played
upon the lawn in front of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day had been an exceedingly hot one—such a day as
the farmers say is excellent for corn—but the evening was
cool and delightful, as all the evenings are in Idaho.</p>

<p class='c008'>We were engaged in watching the children as they played
and listening to their merry laughter. As the evening wore
on and the dusk deepened into darkness, when the little
girl, tired of play, came and sat in her little chair on the
veranda, our conversation took a more serious turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Charlie was a visitor from Fall River, Massachusetts, and
in that city was employed in the office of a large factory in
the capacity of bookkeeper. I think his salary was at that
time about eighty dollars per month. He was spending his
three weeks’ vacation with us.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Braden,” said he, “I learned to-day that your book
‘Co-operative Economy’ is probably responsible for your
being Governor of Idaho and President of the Association.
I have never read it, but my two days’ visit in Co-opolis
makes me anxious to read it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” I replied. “Probably the book did have more to
do with my selection than anything else. I certainly hope
you will read it, because I have endeavored in that book to
explain the whole co-operative system as industrially applied
in this state, and, while you will hardly read it for
pleasure, you will understand our system better if you
study it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>The term of President Henderson of Co-opolis had expired
the year before and I had been selected to succeed
him both as President of the Association and Governor of
Idaho. I had also completed the latter part of 1910 my
work referred to by Charlie Woodberry. Whatever may be
said of the book, it was a success from the outset.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was adopted as a text-book in all the co-operative
schools in Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Utah, California,
Colorado, Nebraska and the two Dakotas, and in many
other states and territories, and was read extensively by the
more intelligent of the general public. Most economic
works were, up to the time “Co-operative Economy” made
its appearance, devoted to analysis and explanation of the
competitive system. My work discussed Co-operation as it
was and as it ought to be. In our schools such a work was
needed, as co-operation was the chief study pursued in conjunction
with all useful branches. I suppose it must be
admitted that this work gives me more satisfaction at this
time than anything I have ever done, because, although the
Publishing department was successful under my administration,
it was not due to my sole efforts. “Co-operative
Economy” was my own thought and was produced outside
of the work which the Association assigned me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Braden,” said Charlie, “I would be glad to ask you
a few questions about co-operation and the Co-opolitan
Association if you would kindly answer them. I have a
general idea of the system, but its features are not clear to
my mind. If I could get in a nutshell a few truths—or
what you claim to be truths—I believe I could read your
books with much more interest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask me any question you please, Charlie. If I cannot
answer them your sister there will,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Charlie and I have already had some correspondence
and talks on the subject,” said Caroline. “He does not
think the system attractive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will not say it is not attractive,” returned Charlie,
shaking his head. “I simply say it is not attractive as I
understand it. Now, take, for instance, the feature which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>makes the Association own everything. That is very distasteful
to me. Nobody can ever own his own home, even.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Charlie,” said I, “that is the way you have been
educated. If you had been taught to believe that personal
ownership of property was a burden, and had a tendency to
diminish your personal security, you would view the case
in a different light. Think a minute. Take a Mongolian
when an infant, transfer him to London, rear him as a
Christian and an Englishman and he will despise the
system and religion of China. But take an English baby
and let him be reared in Pekin as a Chinaman and he will
doubtless hold London and Christianity in abhorrence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We talk of the peculiarities of the Chinese mind, and
doubtless there are many which have been formed by the
education and environments of centuries of time; but
the Chinese education is more responsible for the Chinese
mind than nature is.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have been taught that it is desirable to have property
stand in your name. In the competitive system to
own property makes you the object of attack. It is dangerous.
You are always fearful that somebody will rob
you. If you own none, in the competitive system, you are
despised, no matter what your personal merits may be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yet you can only use what you own and you can do no
more with what you borrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why should you wish to own it, then, if you only get
the use of it in any event? In the co-operative system it
has been found convenient to have individuals own certain
things. They own their own furniture, their clothes,
wall pictures and small ornaments. In short, they own
whatever in the house is severable from it, including tools
which they employ for private use and what they can
lightly carry about their person.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They do not own house or grounds. They simply have
the use of them. But they are entitled to the use of house,
grounds and all the conveniences connected with them as
long as they wish. Their children after them are entitled to
that use. In the competitive system you cannot get more.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Co-operation also assumes the cares of the Co-operators as
far as material things are concerned. You do not have to
worry about the ownership of that which has no other than
use value. In competition you have to own your property,
care for it personally, protect it and pay taxes. This diverts
your mind from thought and fills it with worry, and in addition
to that people overlook your merit and inquire, not
what you are, but what you have, and woe betide you, whatever
your merit, if you have nothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But does not common ownership and the inability of
the occupant to own his home render him careless and
wasteful? Does he take such an interest in his home as
he would if he could call it his?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The ownership of the home in the competitive system
does not make the owner so careful to avoid waste as our
system makes the tenant. As I have said, the occupant, be
he owner or tenant, can enjoy only the use of his house
during his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the competitive system how many owners waste their
houses? Some are drunkards and mortgage them and waste
their value in drink. Some are gamblers, and lose the value
at the gaming table. Some insure them and burn them to
get the insurance money. Some go into business, mortgage
the home for money or credit, fail and lose the property.
Thousands of houses stand idle and go to waste in
every competitive state, while thousands of homeless people
walk the streets in every large city or tramp the country
roads. In our system the state cares for every home and
make a home for every man. The man knows his home
is permanent. It cannot be taken from him without his
consent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But he cannot convey it to his children,” said Charlie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. He cannot compel his children to take it whether
they will or not. But if the children desire it, when the
occupant dies or departs, they may have it on the same
terms if they are members of the Industrial Army that their
parents did. Let me say, however, that when the children
marry they generally present a design of a house which suits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>them better than the old homestead and the Association
builds them a house to suit them. Is not that better?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So much for the home,” remarked Charlie. “I am almost
satisfied with your explanation. It at least gives me
the cue so that I can study the subject fully. Now, I have
long felt that you were asking a man to be a slave and give
up his personal liberty by entering the Industrial Army.
Why is not that true?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Charlie, are you a slave to-day?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, indeed!” exclaimed Charlie, almost indignant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is a government official a slave?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about a soldier in the regular army?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, he is certainly not a slave.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How about a clerk in the postoffice department, for instance?
Is he not in the same position as a member of the
Industrial Army?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. It is a similar service, but he serves his government
and country.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is your business, Charlie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Accountant for the Waumkeag Cotton Manufacturing
Company.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are your wages?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eighty dollars per month.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How many hours a day do you work?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ten hours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it slavery to work ten hours a day for a private corporation,
for eighty dollars per month, and not own any interest
in the corporation? Remember that the Co-opolitan
Association pays one hundred dollars per month and requires
only seven hours’ work per day at the most. Then
every minute’s work in the competitive system is for private
persons, while in the co-operative system it is for the public
good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well. But suppose I should want to leave the service of
the Association after I had worked for it ten years or less.
Could I withdraw my part of the accumulated wealth and
take it away?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“You could withdraw your wages and no more. You
could go where you please with the wages.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the accumulated capital. Would it not be unjust
not to let me have my part of that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Charlie! I forgive you, of course, but you are brilliantly
stupid. How long have you been at work for the corporation
which now employs you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Three years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you should work for that corporation fifty years
would you get any more than your wages if you should
withdraw?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who would get the benefit of your work?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, the stockholders.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, or perhaps the bondholders! You could invest
your wages in stock in that corporation if you chose. You
cannot invest them in the Association. But after investing
in the cotton company you are liable to be frozen out by the
big holders. Now, frankly, do you not see that you may
work forty years for your company and then in old age
have not enough to sustain life from day to day? This
could not occur in our system. We exact now twenty-five
years’ work of each member and then he is free. After he
has given us twenty-five years’ work he becomes entitled to
his dividend for the rest of his life just the same as if he
worked.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That sounds well, Mr. Braden. But have you any such
retired members yet?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must not call them retired members. We believe
that those who earn freedom by twenty-five years’ work will
be among our most useful members. They will still be interested
in our work. They will still participate in our elections.
They will take a personal interest in maintaining
and guarding the Association whence they draw their
income. Our Association is now only fifteen years old. In
ten years more three hundred of us will be entitled to release
from systematic labor. It is possible that the Association
will give us earlier release, as our co-operative wealth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>is so great at present, and is increasing so rapidly, that we
are considering the propriety of diminishing the number
of hours of labor per day to six and the number of years to
twenty. We have many persons who have earned long furloughs.
In every such instance the member during his or
her furlough is a useful member. If he travels he brings
home to us the best of information. If he seeks pleasure
he studies that very important pursuit and we learn from
him how to make life enjoyable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You certainly are able to make pertinent and seemingly
complete answers, Mr. Braden. I shall ask my questions
now, not to puzzle but to elicit information. Suppose a
member becomes sick. Does that stop his income or
dividend?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If a member becomes sick he is turned over to the
Health department. As long as he is in the charge of the
Health department his income continues.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who pays for his treatment by physicians?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He pays for it himself out of his income from the
Association.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suppose he should wish to change his climate in order
to recover? How shall he make a change?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the Health department reports such a remedy for any
sick member of the Industrial Army leave of absence is
granted and he is permitted to go to such climate as is
recommended.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suppose a man dies leaving a wife and family after five
years’ employment. What does the Association do for the
family?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The funeral expenses are paid and the family receives
the deceased member’s income until the youngest child
becomes of age, provided the child remains in the Educational
department. If the widow is healthy and able to
work she is received into the Industrial Army.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When a man enters the Army does he become entitled
to the full income of a member in good standing at once?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He does not. The first year he or she receives only
one-third of the income of a member. The second year and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>all years after he receives as much as anyone. Members
are on probation the first year. The three years members
are entitled to promotion to higher grades and the members
during the first three years are required to do the drudgery
of the Association. We have made exceptions to this rule
when we have offered inducements to skilled laborers, but
otherwise all who enlist, especially from the Department
of Education, must pass through the three years course.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“One more question, Mr. Braden, and I will ask no more
until I have read some chapters of ‘Co-operative Economy.’
Do not your members regard a new volunteer as an
intruder? Do they not consider that he is suddenly admitted
to share what they have produced without making
an equal contribution? You have, say, three million dollars’
worth of wealth in Idaho. Why should one who never assisted
in producing it be admitted to participate in its benefits
without paying a large membership fee?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He does pay a fee of one hundred dollars and he gives
the first year’s labor for one-third the income of one member
for that time. If he has not one hundred dollars we do
not always exclude him. We simply take it out of his income.
But you must remember that the Association is a
great corporation, in which the shares are not transferable
and one member can only own one share. The Association
keeps all the machinery and sources of production in its
exclusive control. Every person who enters to-day agrees
to furnish twenty-five years’ labor. No person can receive
the benefit of such a membership unless he so agrees. The
Association, therefore, has as many twenty-five-year contracts
as there are members of the Industrial Army. Let
us suppose that one member has worked for twenty-four
years when a new member is admitted. The latter is now
to work twenty-five years and the former one. The latter
is to give twenty-five years’ work to the former, who one
year later must depend upon the labor of the latter to support
him. Tell me which of these men is getting the advantage,
the man whose twenty-five years of labor in the
past has provided the machinery and improved the source
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of production or the man whose twenty-five years of the
future will operate the machine and render the source of
production fruitful. Is it not a fair bargain after all? If
a man forty-six retires from labor and a man twenty-one
takes his place and supports him will the former object?”</p>

<p class='c008'>This closed the economic discussion. My wife did not
take part except as a listener, but she was deeply interested.
Our little girl had fallen asleep in her arms and she now
softly arose and carried her into the sleeping apartment.
Charlie and I still continued on the veranda a little longer
enjoying the pure and cool atmosphere, and pursued our
conversation on lighter subjects.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE TERM OF SERVICE—THE SURVIVORS OF TWENTY YEARS—SPREAD OF CO-OPERATION—SECRET OF CO-OPOLITAN SUCCESS—1917.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>An important question came up before the Legislative
Council at one of its meetings in May, 1916. It was as to
whether the term of service in the Industrial Army should
be reduced from twenty-five to twenty years.</p>

<p class='c008'>After full discussion it was decided to refer the matter to
popular vote at the referendum election of October following.
It was accordingly referred, but not in the form in
which it was at first considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question submitted was: “Whether the term of
service in the Industrial Army shall be reduced to twenty
years to all members in the Grade of Honor at the expiration
of that time.” All persons who had performed their
duties faithfully and whom their companies, by a majority
vote, recommended to advancement to the Grade of Honor
were, after serving fifteen years, so advanced.</p>

<p class='c008'>This had the effect of rendering our workers more diligent,
and it was believed by the members of the Legislative
Council that if men could shorten their term of service five
years by industry and faithfulness it would increase the
efficiency of the Industrial Army. The people of Idaho
thought so, too, and after a most thorough discussion, in
which it was made apparent that the Association could well
afford to shorten the term, the election of October resulted
in a practically unanimous decision in favor of twenty
years.</p>

<p class='c008'>The 20th of May, 1917, completed the service of thirty-six
members. Twenty years before our little company of
fifty, under the leadership of John Thompson, had entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Deer Valley and established our camp on the present site of
Co-opolis. Since then fourteen of that company had
passed to “that country from whose bourne no traveler returns.”
The thirty-six who remained were nearly all of
them high in the councils of the Association and some had
achieved reputations which extended beyond the limits of
Idaho.</p>

<p class='c008'>We who composed that little company were, on this
twentieth anniversary, released from the burdens and duties
attaching to the Co-opolitan system, and thenceforward
were entitled to come and go at will. Wheresoever we
chose a habitation in the state the Association undertook
to provide us with suitable houses, and, our income continuing
as large as if we were still employed, we were expected
to, and could, pay the rental of the house and our living and
other expenses without stint.</p>

<p class='c008'>One dollar of credit, as represented by the labor-credit
check, was neither depreciable nor appreciable by the act
of interested or disinterested persons. Abundance or scarcity
of any product, as measured by the demand for it, was
the determining factor of price. Our credit dollar was invested
with large purchasing power because co-operation
produced abundance and guaranteed to each of us a quantity
of any needed article, and a quality of comfort, pleasure,
convenience or accommodation equal to the fair exchange
value of labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thirty-six whose service ceased on this anniversary
were men who were devoted to the principle of co-operation
and ready to make any sacrifice to the success of the Co-opolitan
Association. Most of them had lived comparatively
frugal lives. For fifteen years the income which they
had derived from their service had been twelve hundred
dollars per annum at least. This was allowed them on the
books of the Association and the labor-credit checks were
delivered to them each month, as to all workers. If they
failed to exhaust their month’s credit during the month
the surplus remained with the Association.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have no banks. We have no money and no department
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>which makes a business of handling money. We
have no occasion to deposit or store labor-credit checks.</p>

<p class='c008'>No man has any claim with us upon anything but the
fruits of labor. These we hold until he calls for them, and
we pay him no interest for their use. In fact, we have no
use for what he leaves with the Association. We prefer to
have him take it and consume it himself. The Association,
for instance, has a menagerie and circus which it sends from
city to city. We see no reason why a man who desires to see
such an exhibition should refrain from doing so from motives
of frugality. The Association prefers that the admission
fee be taken out of every labor-credit check. Of course
this does not usually happen, because the members do not
always desire to witness such an exhibition when it appears.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a man is frugal and spends but little of his monthly
credit he does not lose it during his life. It is a matter of
prudence to save something, so that he may use it if he goes
abroad, and the Association holds itself ready to furnish
him the money of any nation if he makes the proper application
for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if a man dies his unexhausted credit is canceled.
He cannot will it to his wife or children. The wife is
given a place in the Industrial Army and his years of service
are accredited to her, so that if he has served ten years
up to the time of his death only fifteen more are required of
her, or ten years if he or she should be a member of the
Grade of Honor.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for children, if they are members of the Educational
department and are left orphans they are allowed the father’s
portion until they arrive at age, when they enter the
Industrial Army. These provisions are necessary to co-operative
success. To permit a man to leave his accumulations
to his son or daughter takes from them the incentive
to labor. They cease to be useful or acquire a superiority
which nature did not give them.</p>

<p class='c008'>We insist that all should be equal in the start, and that
they have no advantages which they cannot create for
themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>The competitor claims that this removes the incentive for
action. This is not true. It removes one incentive out of
many, and the worst and most injurious one.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is an incentive which makes robbers, thieves, murderers
and tyrants and produces a host of evils.</p>

<p class='c008'>The competitor says it is unjust because it takes from
wife and child their support. It does not. We give the
wife a chance to be useful and an income for her use equal
to the income of any.</p>

<p class='c008'>We give the child his education and an opportunity
equal to the best when he becomes a man. We insure these
things and the husband and father is relieved from all
worry on their account while he lives. Is not this worth
many times the riches of the competitor which are so ready
to vanish and leave wife and child in the ranks of abject
and despised poverty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The twentieth year of the Co-operative Commonwealth is
indeed a proud one. The great state which we occupy is
entirely under the control of the Co-opolitan Association.
It contains four million people and two and a half million
active members of the Industrial Army. Its inhabitants
are all in cities, but no city is greater than one hundred and
fifty thousand persons, except Idaho Falls and Shoshone,
where the great water power, generating electricity, gives
exceptional advantages for manufactures. Idaho Falls contains
three hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants and
Shoshone two hundred and twenty-one thousand. In Shoshone
are the great flouring and woolen mills, but nearly
every needful and useful article is also produced through
the medium of its marvelous electric power. Idaho Falls
is more famous for its cotton mills, and other cities are
numerous which are devoted to manufactures of various
kinds. The city of Rokybar is the Pittsburg of Idaho and
the Association steel works at that city are the largest in
the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Laselle is the producer of beet sugar, and all the sugar
used by our department stores in Idaho is supplied from
our factories there. There is little necessity for the importation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>of anything into this state, so varied and abundant
are its resources and productions.</p>

<p class='c008'>These cities of Idaho are all laid out and conducted on
the plan of Co-opolis. Each one of them covers an area
nearly three times as large as that of any competitive city.
The streets are all one hundred and fifty feet wide, consisting
of two driveways fifty feet wide and a park of equal
width separating them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Numerous parks are located at convenient distances from
one another. The buildings are all at least fifty feet apart.
There is ample sunlight, pure air and space for children to
play or for older people to take recreation.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are flowers, fountains, artificial lakes and trees in
profusion. Monuments and statues have been erected in
many localities, representing art and history and illustrating
the power and beauty of co-operation. The streets are
all paved with asphalt. Most of our buildings are constructed
of brick or stone and of the material necessary for
the purpose Idaho has inexhaustible resources.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this twentieth year of the Co-operative Commonwealth
the United States is moving swiftly and quietly to
that condition which Bellamy beheld in “Looking Backward.”
Washington was the first state to join Idaho as a
Co-operative Commonwealth, which it did in 1910. Oregon,
Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Nebraska,
North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana and
California followed in quick succession in about the order
named. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,
Tennessee, Arkansas, North and South Carolina and Texas
are almost ready to wheel into line.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for the other states of the Union, the co-operative
system is gaining ground every day. In the United States
Senate there are forty Co-operative Senators. In the House
of Representatives there are one hundred and forty-three
Co-operators.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the influence of Idaho the United States government
has purchased and now operates five transcontinental
lines of railroad, and it is probable that it will, in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>few years, acquire most of the lines which are sufficiently
valuable to warrant their operation. It owns all the telegraph
lines in its territory, having purchased them as early
as 1908.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nearly all the cities of the country have become the owners
of their own public utilities, such as street-car lines,
telephone, gas, electric and water systems and plants, and
from the income derived from them have almost succeeded
in relieving their citizens from the burden of taxation.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the private department stores, labor-saving machinery,
trusts and monopolies, which continue to exact
tribute from and oppress the people for private gain, are
our unconscious and unintentional allies, and the thousands
of good citizens who yearly move westward to avail
themselves of the opportunities which exist in the Co-operative
Commonwealths called into being by the success of the
Co-opolitan Association do not fail by their correspondence
to light the fires of the new and higher civilization in every
city and hamlet of the nation.</p>

<p class='c008'>This success is one which Idaho and her people are, at
this time, disposed to credit, in a somewhat larger degree
than history will or should approve, to the immortal senior
Senator from Idaho, Hon. John Thompson, and his associates
of twenty years ago. All honor, indeed, to them!</p>

<p class='c008'>But I maintain that conditions, circumstances and a
great nation of intelligent, honest, industrious and comparatively
temperate laboring men and women made their work
possible in America when it could not have been successful
in any other country in this world.</p>

<p class='c008'>I do not say this from motives of patriotism. I say it
because it appears to me that the reasons to support the
allegation will be recognized and approved when stated.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first place, there has never before been any extensive
experiment with industrial co-operation for the benefit
of the workers engaged in it, where land was the basis of
all operations, except in ancient Peru.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is unfortunate that history has been so far deprived of
the records of that wonderful country, by the destructive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>fanaticism of its Spanish conquerors, that the details of its
system must remain obscure.</p>

<p class='c008'>But happily the indisputable fact remains to give courage
to co-operators who do battle in the dark corners of the
world that Peru was a co-operative or socialistic state, and
that its people were happy, prosperous and contented.</p>

<p class='c008'>This fact suggests the very pertinent question whether
the people who boast a high state of civilization like that of
modern New York and Boston are equal to the establishment
of a system as just, as fair and as equitable in the production,
distribution and protection of wealth as the comparatively
ignorant, simple-minded and uncivilized inhabitants
of ancient Peru?</p>

<p class='c008'>The example of Idaho proves that we are. But in England,
France and Germany the co-operators have confined
their undertakings almost exclusively to manufactures and
distribution. The land has rarely entered into their calculations,
or when it has been considered has never been regarded
as available. In Idaho we have made land the chief
feature of our enterprise, and I maintain and, in fact, know,
that we could never have succeeded in any marked degree
if we had not done so.</p>

<p class='c008'>A commonwealth which has not the title to its own land
is like a house suspended in the air. Even the co-operative
societies engaged in manufacture and distribution manufacture
and distribute what comes, primarily, from the
land.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they receive the raw material to manufacture or
distribute it has been handled by a number of traders,
brokers and other middlemen and its price increased oppressively.
We avoided all this by owning the land.</p>

<p class='c008'>In England and other densely populated countries the
rich land has all been taken and the owner, whether lord
or peasant, will not part with it except for a large sum of
money. The co-operator is thus excluded, in those countries,
from the use of land. It costs him nearly as much in
spot cash to acquire it as the brokers and traders take from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>him, through a series of years, in profits on the raw product
of land.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now in Idaho land was cheap, and cheap land is the
co-operator’s salvation.</p>

<p class='c008'>I also believe that we were fortunate in locating our
colonies in Idaho. The reason for this is that after we had
acquired the land of Deer Valley, placed it under irrigation
and rendered it highly productive, we had the use of millions
of acres of grazing lands for our herds and flocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>I cannot conceive that a co-operative society could begin
its career under more favorable conditions than did the Co-opolitan.
It could not have found a better location for its
productive farm and city in any other state. It had the best
facilities for irrigation and controlling all the waters necessary
to render its land productive; it had the means to attach
its members to the common purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was able to avail itself of near and high-priced markets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Better than all this, it had the open ranges embracing
millions of acres of good grazing land, which it was permitted
by the laws to use without cost. If we had not possessed
this advantage, my judgment is that our struggle
would have been increased and prolonged.</p>

<p class='c008'>I believe that cattle and sheep were the most advantageous
kind of wealth for us to handle. We allowed them to
roam at will, with but few attendants, over our ranges, and
we were at little expense to care for and feed them. Besides
this it was a form of wealth which was capable of
transporting itself to some extent. Had we attempted a
different location where there were no ranges and put our
capital into almost any other form of property we would
have failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>These natural advantages and the system whose development
I have endeavored in these pages to trace are, in my
judgment, responsible for the success which the Co-opolitan
Association has made in twenty years.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>L’ENVOI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>My narrative, kind reader, is finished, but if you have followed
it thus far you will doubtless feel some interest in the
present condition of some of its chief characters and features.
Of Senator Thompson I need say only that he is one
of the most honored and famous individualities in this
world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Being a native of England, he is not eligible to the Presidency
of the republic, else I verily believe he would be
chosen to usher in the Co-operative Commonwealth which
seems to be one of the probabilities in the near future. But
Senator Thompson is in the prime of manhood and you
can be sure that he will be one of the chief actors in the
coming change.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Braden is as famous in her sphere as Senator
Thompson is in his. Having written, as the world knows,
five novels of the highest merit, all of which have been received
with extraordinary favor, the Association has rewarded
her by remitting her entire term of service in the
Industrial Army. This has not had the effect of silencing
her muse by any means. She is as industrious as if both
fame and fortune were wanting. The fires of true genius
do not require the inspiration of greed to make them burn
more brightly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Edmunds is now an old man. He will accept the ease
which the expiration of his term of service enables him to
enjoy. Although seventy years of age, he is strong and
hearty, and we hope may live, as he seems likely to, for
many years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Henry B. Henderson died three years ago. A bronze
statue of him stands in the park on Commonwealth Avenue,
in front of the Council Hall, and I am told that the
people of Shoshone and Idaho Falls are arranging to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>similar statues erected and paid for by subscription in their
cities.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boise City is a beautiful city of fifty thousand inhabitants.
The municipal indebtedness of the old city was long
ago purchased by the Co-opolitan Association for a small
sum and the flood of co-operative enterprise poured over
and through the old townsite at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>The city of CO-OPOLIS is not, as I have already stated,
the largest city in Idaho. It contains a population of one
hundred and fifty thousand. It is the oldest co-operative
city in the state and the most beautiful in the world. Its
buildings are substantially constructed; its parks are well
kept and better finished than are those of most other cities,
and its trees are older and more mature. It is believed that
it will be the favorite city of residence for the members
whose terms of service in the Industrial Army expire. At
present it is the seat of government in the Association
domain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Idaho is still a “Light on the Mountains,” as its ancient
name implies, and its effulgence had found a shining way
into thousands of homes throughout the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Truly may it be said that her mission is being grandly
accomplished and that the people that dwelt in darkness
have seen a great light.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thank God! The higher civilization is here.</p>

<p class='c008'>We believe in the efficacy of object lessons, and the Social
Democracy of America is working for and advocating
the Co-operative Commonwealth, where all shall receive
their full share of the wealth they create and the Brotherhood

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>COLONIZATION COMMISSION</div>

<p class='c015'>of the Social Democracy of America has formulated plans
and methods for putting the ideas contained in this book
into actual operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>If one million working men would pay ten cents each into
a fund to help such a plan, it would mean one hundred thousand
dollars a month, or one million two hundred thousand
dollars a year. If one hundred thousand should do so, it
would mean one thousand dollars a month and one hundred
and twenty thousand dollars a year. In five years, with
judicious management and cautious expenditure of such
funds, the results would be marvelous, especially as a dollar
in the hands of co-operators would prove far more efficient
than a dollar employed in the extravagant and wasteful
channels of competition.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Send a dollar for thirty-four sample copies and make thirty-four
converts to the cause of reform.</p>

<p class='c008'>Six cents will pay for “Merrie England,” a book of 190
pages, which has had a sale of 850,000 copies in England
and has only begun to sell in America. It is a popular yet
scientific statement of the principles of Socialism. It is addressed
to the people who are prejudiced against anything
of the kind. Get a man to read “Merrie England” and the
book will do the rest. We mail two copies for 10 cents,
twelve for 50 cents, twenty-five for $1.00, a hundred for
$3.50.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ten cents will pay for “President John Smith,” by Frederick
Upham Adams, a book of 300 pages. It has passed
through twenty-five editions in a year. It is a success because
it points out practical methods for intelligent political
action by which the people of the United States may
take possession of the government and run it in their own
interest. We mail a dozen copies for $1.00; fifty copies
for $3.75.</p>

<p class='c008'>Twenty-five cents will pay for any one of the following

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>“The Legal Revolution of 1902” purports to be a
history of social conditions in the United States for a
period of about fifteen years following the year 1897. It
attempts to picture changes and reforms amounting to
an industrial revolution—which I think should, and will,
be made—as if the country had already passed through
this period. All matters of fact recorded as having
taken place before 1897, or “before the Revolution,” are
true; quotations from newspapers and other publications,
and utterances of men, prior to that year, are also true;
whatever is mentioned as occurring afterward is, of
course, fiction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the characters in this narrative bear the same
names as distinguished persons of to-day, but no pretense
nor claim is made that they speak or represent in any
manner the views or sentiments of those whose names
they may happen to bear. The characters have been
named to give added interest to the story, to connect it
more plainly with the evident trend of social and political
conditions, and to more clearly elucidate the opportunities
which lie within the power of men.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal idea of the work is to show the people
their power, wherein it lies, and the methods of exercising
it to right their grievances, if they feel that such
exist.</p>

<p class='c008'>If I succeed in bringing all who read these pages to
a full understanding of the power of the people, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>how to use that power, and wherein lies the basis, the
very foundation, of our institutions, I shall be content,
even though they do not agree with this story as to the
extent of existing evils, or the measures it inaugurates to
alleviate them. While endeavoring to clothe my ideas
in an interesting and readable narrative, some exaggerations
have been made; yet, in confidence to the reader, it
must be said that, in the main, I believe in every line of
the work; in the principle of every reform proposed; in
every change pictured and result prophesied. Indeed, I
can see no other road for a law-abiding, intelligent and
prosperous people to travel, and no other possible destination
to be reached, than the one herein imperfectly
portrayed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, mother, I’ll run down and get the mail,” said
John Brown to his wife, as he started for the village postoffice.
On arriving there he found his “grist” of daily
papers that regularly visited his home, and also two letters.
One was addressed “Hon. John Brown, Member
of the Illinois Legislature.” He looked at it and incidentally
remarked to a friend with whom he was conversing:
“I wonder who that is from—‘Return in five days
to Mark Mishler, Attorney-at-Law, Springfield, Ill.’; I
guess it is not of much importance to me; I don’t know
any such person.” And with that he put it, unopened,
into his pocket, and looked at the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, New York, from brother Benjamin! I
haven’t heard from him in a long time. Mother and I
were just talking about him and wondering if he had
forgotten us. She’ll want to hear the news, and I had
better go right back to the house,” and he started, carrying
the letter and papers in his hand. It was but a few
minutes’ walk, and he was soon home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“See here, mother, a letter from Ben,” he said, starting
to tear it open.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it possible!” she exclaimed, with considerable surprise;
“we haven’t heard from him since his wife died.
He is no hand to write, and I’ll warrant it is news of importance;
probably sad news, or we wouldn’t hear from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>him now. You remember he never wrote us that Glen
(his only child) was born until he was two years old. Of
course he wrote during that time, but never mentioned
that fact, and it was so strange, since he always writes so
much about him now, when he writes at all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time the letter was opened, the spectacles adjusted
to his nose, and Mr. Brown began to read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My Dear Brother and Sister—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“You know how difficult it is for me to write, and I am
sure you won’t think strange because of not having heard
from me before. I often think of you both, and have
frequently resolved to write, but have neglected it until
days, weeks and months have slipped away. I am in
deep trouble now. You know that ten years ago the
company set me back to flagman. The wages for such a
position are very low; I have been able only to live and
keep the family, and have found it impossible to lay by
anything. A year ago an accident, a collision, occurred
in the yards between a couple of switching freight trains.
It was charged to me and I was ‘laid off.’ Perhaps I
was to blame. I worked long hours and was very tired.
I am getting old, anyway. My eyes, and faculties as
well, are getting dim. Since then I have had no work,
and have employed my time about the garden and with
my poultry, out of which I have made a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Glen, though only sixteen, had completed school,
and had also learned the glassblower’s trade in the factory
here, and with my pension and what little I could
earn was able to support me and keep the house up in
good shape, so I did not feel badly. In my old age I
felt I had earned a rest, and Glen, noble boy! was satisfied,
and insisted that I should have it. But now, just
as he has his trade well learned, and had, as we supposed,
the means of gaining a livelihood through life for himself
and a way of supporting me in my old age, improved
machines were introduced into many of the larger factories,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>that almost entirely displaced the glassblower and
absolutely ruined his trade. They were not put in the
factory here, but it was seen that the factory would be
unable to compete with the machine-equipped factories,
and that they must put them in or close up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After the machines began to be used it was evident
that half the factories would supply the market. So
the big ones all joined together into one big company, or
trust, and closed up a number of the factories. The one
here went into the big company, and the Board of Directors
of the big concern voted it to be one of the factories
that would be permanently closed. Lots of the machinery
has been moved away, and there is little probability
of it ever being operated again. At any rate it has
now been closed for three months, and Glen has been unable
to find a day’s work of any kind to do, and there is
little hope of any here. Glassblowers have been laid off
in all the factories that are still running, and those now
retained are taken from the force of older employes and
there is no chance whatever for a new man now. So
Glen will probably never find work again at his trade.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the town! You have no idea of the condition
here. The glass factory was almost the sole industry.
There is not another enterprise of any importance. Two
thousand men, who fed ten thousand people, or the whole
town, are thrown out of employment at the mandate of a
trust, and the whole place is ruined. No western cyclone
ever wrought worse havoc, because after one of them has
passed the people can go to work and rebuild, but there
is nothing here they can do to get even bread to eat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The very day it was known the factory would be permanently
closed residence property depreciated one-half,
and in fact it is scarcely worth anything now, and will
not sell at any price. My place, which cost me a lifetime
of toil, and for which I paid $2,500 principal and no
end of interest, will not sell to-day for $500.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the question with the people here is, not how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>much their property has depreciated in value, but how
they are to get work by which to earn a living.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Glen and I think we want to go West. We would
like to go out where you are, and want to know what you
think about it. Can we make a living there? We have
been thinking if we could get a little patch of ground
near some good-sized town we could, by gardening and
poultry raising (at which I am becoming expert, by the
way), get along and make a living; and Glen is a bright
scholar, and I have been thinking that perhaps he could
get work of some kind out there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want to be a burden on you, but God knows I
will be on the state if things continue as they are. And
Glen, he deserves a better fate than the world seems to
have allotted him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please let me hear from you soon. With kind regards
to sister Jane and yourself,</p>

      <div class='line'>“I am, your brother,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“BENJAMIN BROWN.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Brown was visibly affected as he slowly read the
letter, and tears filled the eyes of both himself and his
wife by the time it was completed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, mother, what had I better write him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>To which the good woman quickly replied: “Send
for them both to come at once and make their home with
us—at least for the present. You will soon go to Springfield,
and will be gone all winter attending the Legislature.
You expect to hire someone to attend the stock
and the farm while you are away, and you always hire in
the summer. Perhaps they might like farm work, and
suit you better than anyone you can hire, and so stay
permanently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Lord has taken all our dear children away,” she
continued; “and if Glen is the boy his father has always</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>“‘Fellow reformers, would you be free? Would you
see the regimen of corporate power and class despotism
at an end? Would you see the shackles stricken forever
from the limbs of humanity, and behold emancipation—the
rebirth? Do you believe that this can come through

<p class='c008'>“‘Have not the reformers spent their lives, their fortunes,
and their energies in the cause of political reform?
Have they not seen the cunning and unscrupulous always
victorious, emerging from every campaign master of the
spoils? Have you any hopes that this will be changed in
the future? The past is one long protest against the
ballot as an instrument of reformation.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scarcely a day passes that I do not receive one or more
appeals to join one or the other of the revolutionary orders
being formed in this country, and offers of money
and arms are frequently received if I will give my efforts
to the cause of revolution. Thus far I have persistently
declined to give aid or encouragement to such movements.
But if, through the writings of such men as Private
Dalzell, revolution comes, in spite of all efforts to
prevent it, I will not be found among the cowards, nor
on the side of the plutocratic classes.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Let me see your scrap-book, please,” said Glen. It
was handed to him, and he settled down to read, while the
others conversed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That letter appeared some time ago,” said Benjamin,
“and I’ll warrant it has been read by every member of a
labor union. I tell you something is going to happen.
Where, or when, or what it is going to be I don’t know,
but I do know the power of the labor unions, and doubt
not they will play an important part in the struggle. I
haven’t a particle of doubt but those societies which Mr.
Sovereign mentions are being formed. It is this great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>chasm between the rich and the poor that is causing the
trouble. The laboring people are piling up wealth, and
it is all being appropriated by the rich, and the poor find
it harder each day to make a living. This is especially
true in the factories of the East, where labor-saving machines
are displacing thousands of laborers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you think,” said Mr. Smith, “that their further
introduction should be prohibited?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The labor unions,” was the reply, “do now, to some
extent. The shoe manufacturers of Lynn have not dared
to introduce a certain lasting machine recently invented,
because the lasters’ union has declared against it, and yet
it is claimed that that machine will revolutionize the shoe
business. You see that shows the strength of the unions,
and what they can do if they get started. Oh, there are
bloody times ahead for us. I believe one of your Western
governors said lately: ‘The high buildings and grand
palaces of our big cities will be spattered with the lungs
and livers of humanity before this thing is adjusted.’
He was called a crank, but he was not far amiss.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am inclined to think,” said Mr. Smith, “that you
take a too serious view of matters. Your brother tells
me the glass factory in your town was permanently closed
by a trust. Is that possible? I never heard of such an
outrage. I should think the managers of the trusts
would be in danger of their lives.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now you are coming to it. See! it makes a revolutionist
out of you to even hear of such a thing,” said Benjamin;
“yet you don’t see revolution coming. Suppose
you knew nothing but one trade, and you found the factory
in which you had worked all your life permanently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>closed by a trust, and it was impossible to ever again
work at your trade. When you become an actor in such
an affair it is worse than a picture in your imagination.
If you were placed in that position you would see what
is coming.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But has it really been permanently closed by the
trust?” he again asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Closed! Why, certainly, and it is nothing new.
Hundreds of factories have been permanently shut down
by trusts, in order to decrease production, raise prices
and throw thousands of laborers out of work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Mr. Smith, “I guess you are right, but
what is it going to be, and what are they going to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“O, I don’t know. They will at least have revenge.
It may be we’ll have anarchy, and the fulfillment of the
bloody scenes painted in that wonderful book, ‘Caesar’s
Column.’ Have you read it? It is fearful. Enough
to curdle a man’s blood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At this point Glen, who was still looking over his
uncle’s scrap-book, said: “I believe Uncle John is getting
to be quite a Socialist, judging from these clippings.
Let me read some of them. They are mostly from the
metropolitan dailies”:</p>

<p class='c008'>“WANT IN THE CITIES.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A few days ago we quoted from an editorial in the
New York Tribune to show that there never before was
such great distress in the chief city in the country as at
present, and that the victims were not merely laboring
men, unable to find employment, but professional people
and small merchants as well. The Times-Herald editorially
testifies that want is as general and intense in Chicago
as in New York. It says:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>“‘Perhaps since the great fire there has not been a
keener occasion for generous giving. The country is
now in the fourth year of a period of hard times. Very
rich men have had their fortunes trimmed, so to speak;
moderately rich men have been reduced to a sharp counting
of the cost of casual luxuries. All classes have suffered
in degree, but thousands and thousands of those
brave folks whose only hope in life is to fight for the ship
till they fall face forward fighting on the deck have been
precipitated from a hard-earned and perilous independence
into a black and hopeless poverty.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* We
do not share the opinion of the versifier who wrote “Organized
charity, cold as ice, in the name of a hard, statistical
Christ,” but we submit that the present crisis,
when ill-clad, half-famished shapes confront us on the
streets; when the cold pinches the denizens of hovels and
tenements; when the children in a thousand squalid
homes cry for sustenance, when women fight for bread
at the county agent’s door, and able-bodied men swarm
on the railroad tracks, eagerly begging fragments of
coal—this crisis is not to be met with perfunctory measures.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“In another article published in its news columns the
Times-Herald declares that:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Chicago has 8,000 families actually starving to
death.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘It has 40,000 wives, husbands and children begging
for a pittance of food to keep body and soul together—huddled
into single rooms and freezing in the blizzard
that visited the city yesterday.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>The next item reads:</p>

<p class='c008'>“DISTRESS IN GREAT CITIES.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The public authorities and organized charities of Chicago
are having more than they can do to care for the
tens of thousands of destitute people in the Garden City,
and the New York Tribune confesses that the want in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>that town is as dire as in Chicago. ‘At no moment within
the memory of the present generation,’ says the Tribune,
‘has the number of unemployed in this city been so large
as just now, and never before has the strain on public and
private charity been so severe as during this winter season
(1896–97). It is not merely the laboring classes—that
is to say, the classes who may be regarded as within
facile reach of philanthropic relief—who are the sufferers,
but those who may be described as professional men,
clerks, the salesmen, the architects and the literary men.
Few, save the clergy and physicians, have any idea of the
extent to which privation and actual want prevail among
these victims of the bad times that are marking the close
of the deplorable Democratic administration, and doctor
and parson alike wax eloquent about the destitution of
the families of those unfortunate men who, while eager
for work and ready to do anything for the sake of a living,
are for the first time in their lives unable to find
employment of any kind.’ After adverting to the sympathy
extended to the unfortunate inmates of Sing Sing
and other prisons, who are losing their sanity because
there is no work to employ them, the Tribune adds: ‘It
may be questioned whether the first duty of the people of
New York is not toward those of their more honest and
honorable fellow-citizens whose enforced idleness, due to
their inability to find any employment, is driving them,
too, to the verge of insanity—an insanity caused not so
much by the brooding over their own unhappy lot as by
the spectacle of their wives and little ones literally starving
before their eyes. It is not merely on the ground of
philanthropy and charity that some means or other
should be devised for their relief, but on the score of policy
and economy. For the less enforced idleness there is
outside the prison the fewer convicts there will be within
its walls.’”</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>In November, 1897, when evil forebodings were everywhere
hovering about, Mark Mishler, a robust, big-hearted,
good-natured lawyer, sat one day in his office at
Springfield, Ill. He had just been beaten in a case he
had tried before the Supreme Court because the law on
which he based the case was declared by the Court to be
unconstitutional. He never was mad; his good soul
would not let him; but if ever he was perplexed it was
now. His mind reverted to the Constitution of the
State. He read it over, as he had done many times before,
but now he took a special interest in reviewing it.
As he read and reread he said to himself: “Thank God!
There is one thing bigger than a Court—that is the Constitution,
and the people are above that yet. They make
the Constitution itself. It ought to have more laws embodied
in it, and this one should have been a part of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And as he thought on, his mind reverted to the Constitution
of the United States. He turned to it and scanned
it over for the first time in many years, perhaps since he
was a law student. He had little practice in the United
States Courts, and had had no occasion to read it. After
he had finished he leaned back in his chair in a meditative
mood, saying to himself: “There is the foundation of
all our institutions, State and National. That was the
beginning. It was the corner-stone of the Republic, and
on it all that is good in this country is based.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>He thought on, and added to himself: “And all that
is evil, then, must likewise find its basis there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The very thought surprised him. In deep meditation,
and with strange, unaccountable feelings, he continued
until he read the article recognizing human slavery, and
declaring the slave trade should not be prohibited before
the year 1808. He always knew that, yet he could hardly
believe his eyes. He read on till he came to the amendment
freeing the slaves, adopted nearly three-quarters of
a century afterward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” he gasped, almost aloud, “I knew that; I
helped pass that very amendment freeing the slaves and,
as we were charged at the time, ‘confiscating millions of
dollars’ worth of property.’ But lawyer as I am, with
twenty-five years of practice, I never thought but Lincoln’s
proclamation freed the slaves.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He dropped back in his chair, lost for half an hour in
silent study. As he sat, entirely consumed in his
own thought, his very countenance unconsciously brightened.
His heart grew light. His eyes beamed within
him. He felt a sort of inspiration. A new idea, and a
happy one indeed, sprang like an angel of light into his
mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>He well knew, and had studied much, of the rise and
fall of the grand ancient civilizations, and with evil forebodings
hovering like a dark, dreary, dangerous cloud
over our land, he had often pondered long as to what
would be the outcome with this one. As he went to
and from his office and his home, and each day met
men strong, hearty, but pale-faced, asking, not for bread,
but in the name of God for work, he could not well prevent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>the question recurring to his mind. He had often
thought the last star of hope for our civilization had almost
set, but as he sat there that moment, in all-absorbing
thought, behind a suddenly beaming countenance,
all those evil forecasts left him. Our civilization would
live! The sad pictures of strikes, riots, war, famine, and
pestilence, and a constantly decaying civilization, were
no longer stern realities. It was like being awakened
from an ugly nightmare by the sweet chipper of the birds
on a bright spring morning, with the beautiful rays of
the rising sun streaming through his windows.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had seen, as by a flashlight, the people’s great highway
to peace, to prosperity, and to happiness. He saw
wherein lay the power, the strength, of the people. The
ballot was indeed all-powerful. When properly applied
it was above and beyond Congress and Courts. It was
the Legislature that made laws for legislatures. It was
the Court of Courts, and from its decision there was no
appeal. He had read again, for the first time in years,
the article (No. V.) in the United States Constitution
providing for its amendment, and for a Constitutional
convention. Through the United States Constitutional
convention the people’s will was law, upon which no
court could pass judgment, even if their law provided
that the Court itself be abolished and the judges retired
to private life without salary or with the additional penalty
that they be transported. Anything the people
wanted they might have. What more could they ask or
hope for by resorting to riot and war? How many of the
people knew this? Practically none of them.</p>
